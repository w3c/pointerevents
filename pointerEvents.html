      This document defines events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices like a mouse, pen, or touchscreen. For compatibility with existing mouse-based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire [[DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] Mouse Events for pointer device types other than mouse.

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <div><p>Today, most [[HTML5]] content is used with and/or designed for mouse input.  Those that handle input in a custom manner typically code to [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] Mouse Events. Newer computing devices today, however, incorporate other forms of input, like touchscreens or pen input. Event types have been proposed for handling each of these forms of input individually. However, that approach requires a step function in opportunity cost to authors when adding support for a new input type. This often creates a compatibility problem when content is written with only one device type in mind. Additionally, for compatibility with existing mouse-based content, most <a title="user agent" class="internalDFN">user agents</a> fire Mouse Events for all input types. This makes it ambiguous whether a Mouse Event represents an actual mouse device or is being produced from another input type for compatibility, which makes it hard to code to both device types simultaneously.</p>
	  
	  <p>To reduce the cost of coding to multiple input types and also to help with the above described ambiguity with Mouse Events, this specifications defines a more abstract form of input, called a <a title="pointer" class="internalDFN">pointer</a>. A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easy to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, this specification also defines properties for inspecting the device type which produced the event. The primary goal is to provide a single set of events and interfaces that allow for easy authoring for cross-device pointer input while still allowing for device-specific handling when necessary.</p>

		<figcaption>A pointer is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen.</figcaption>
	  </figure>
	  
	  <p>The events for handling generic pointer input look a lot like those for mouse: pointerdown, pointermove, pointerup, pointerover, pointerout, etc. This facilitates easy content migration from Mouse Events to Pointer Events.
		Pointer Events provide all the usual properties present in Mouse Events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. So authors can easily code to Pointer Events and their content just works no matter what input hardware is being used.</p>

			<h2>Button States</h2>
			<section>
				<h3><dfn title="chorded buttons">Chorded Button Interactions</dfn></h3>
				<div><p>Some pointer devices, such as mouse or pen, support multiple buttons. In the [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] Mouse Event model, each button press produces a <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event.  To better abstract this hardware difference and simplify cross-device input authoring, Pointer Events do not fire overlapping <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events for <a title="chorded buttons" class="internalDFN">chorded button presses</a> (depressing an additional button while another button on the pointer device is already depressed).</p> 
<p>Instead, chorded button presses can be detected by inspecting changes to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties. The <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties are inherited from the [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] <code>MouseEvent</code> interface. In order to facilitate differentiating button state transitions in any pointer event (and not just <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code>), the <code>button</code> property takes on a new value when no mouse buttons are depressed:</p>
				<table class="simple">
					<thead><tr><th>Device Button State</th><th><code>button</code></th><th><code>buttons</code></th></tr></thead>
					<tbody>
						<tr><td><b>Mouse move with no buttons pressed</b></td><td>-1</td><td>0</td></tr>

						<tr><td>X1 (back) Mouse</td><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
						<tr><td>X2 (forward) Mouse</td><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr>
						<tr><td>Pen contact with eraser button pressed</td><td>5</td><td>32</td></tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>
				<section class="note">These values only apply when firing pointer events. This specification does not alter the values of <code>button</code> or <code>buttons</code> used when firing mouse events. See [[DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] for the values when firing mouse events.</section>

			<h2><dfn title="primary pointer">The Primary Pointer</dfn></h2>
			<div><p>In a multi-pointer (e.g. multi-touch) scenario, the primary pointer is used to identify a master pointer amongst the set of active pointers.  This pointer is the one that will produce <a title="compatibility mouse events" class="internalDFN">compatibility mouse events</a>. It is also useful when single-pointer interaction is desired by an author.</p>
			<p>The primary pointer is indicated on events by a value of <code>true</code> for the <a href="#widl-PointerEvent-isPrimary"><code>isPrimary</code></a> property.</div>
			<section>
				<h3>Determining the primary pointer</h3>
				<div>When dispatching a pointer event, a pointer is considered primary if:
					<ul>
						<li>The pointer represents a mouse device.</li>
						<li>The pointer represents a primary touch input.</li>
						<li>The pointer represents a primary pen input.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<dl>
					<dt>primary touch input</dt><dd>A pointer representing touch input is considered the <i>primary touch input</i> if its <code>pointerdown</code> event was dispatched when no other active pointers representing touch input existed.</dd>
					<dt>primary pen input</dt><dd>A pointer representing pen input is considered the <i>primary pen input</i> if its <code>pointerdown</code> event was dispatched when no other active pointers representing pen input existed.</dd>
				</dl>
				<div class="note">When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers are considered primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will produce pointers that are both considered primary.</div>
				<div class="note">In some platforms, the primary pointer is determined using all active pointers on the device including those not targeted at the user agent (e.g. in another application). This means it is possible for the user agent to fire pointer events in which no pointer is marked as the primary pointer.  For example, if the first touch interaction is targeted outside the user agent and a secondary (multi-touch) touch interaction is targeted inside the user agent, then the user agent fires pointer events for the second contact with a value of <code>false</code> for <code>isPrimary</code>.</div>

	<h1>Declaring candidate regions for default touch behaviors</h1>
	<p>For touch input, the default action of any and all pointer events MUST NOT be a manipulation of the viewport (e.g. panning or zooming).</p>
	<div class="note">Touch manipulations are intentionally not a default action of pointer events. Removing this dependency on the cancellation of events facilitates performance optimizations by the user agent.</div>

		<h2>The <code>touch-action</code> CSS property</h2>
		<table class="simple">
			<tr><th>Name:</th><td><code>touch-action</code></td></tr>
			<tr><th>Value:</th><td><code>auto</code> | <code>none</code> | [<code>pan-x</code> || <code>pan-y</code>]</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Initial:</th><td><code>auto</code></td></tr>
			<tr><th>Applies to:</th><td>block-level elements, SVG elements</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Inherited:</th><td>no</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Percentages:</th><td>N/A</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Media:</th><td>visual</td></tr>
			<tr><th>Computed value:</th><td>Same as specified value.</td></tr>
		</table>
		<div>
			<p>The <code>touch-action</code> CSS property determines whether touch input MAY  trigger default behavior supplied by user agent.  This includes, but is not limited to, behaviors such as panning or zooming.</p>
			
			<p>Values have the following meanings:</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>auto</dt><dd>The user agent MAY determine any permitted touch behaviors, such as panning and zooming manipulations of the viewport, for touches that begin on the element.</dd>
				<dt>none</dt><dd>Touches that begin on the element MUST NOT trigger default touch behaviors.</dd>
				<dt>pan-x</dt><dd>The user agent MAY consider touches that begin on the element only for the purposes of horizontally scrolling the element's nearest ancestor with horizontally scrollable content.</dd>
				<dt>pan-y</dt><dd>The user agent MAY consider touches that begin on the element only for the purposes of vertically scrolling the element's nearest ancestor with vertically scrollable content.</dd>
			</dl>
			<section class="note">The terms &quot;pan&quot; and &quot;scroll&quot; are considered synonymous. Defining an interaction or gesture for triggering panning or scrolling, or for triggering behavior for the <code>auto</code> or <code>none</code> values are out of scope for this specification.</section>
			
			<p>When a user touches an element, the effect of that touch is determined by the value of the <code>touch-action</code> property and the default touch behaviors on the element and its ancestors. To determine the effect of a touch, find the nearest ancestor (starting from the element itself) that has a default touch behavior.  Then examine the <code>touch-action</code> property of each element between the hit tested element and the element with the default touch behavior (including both the hit tested element and the element with the default touch behavior).  If the <code>touch-action</code> property of any of those elements disallows the default touch behavior, do nothing.  Otherwise allow the element to start considering the touch for the purposes of executing a default touch behavior.</p>

			<p>During the execution of a behavior, the user agent MUST NOT dispatch subsequent pointer events for the pointer. The user agent MUST dispatch a <code>pointercancel</code> (and subsequently a <code>pointerout</code> event) whenever all of the following are true, in order to end the stream of events for the pointer:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The user agent has determined (via methods out of scope for this specification) that touch input is to be consumed for a touch behavior,</li>
				<li>a <code>pointerdown</code> event has been sent for the pointer, and</li>
				<li>a <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code> event (following the above mentioned <code>pointerdown</code>) has not yet been sent for the pointer.</li>
			</ul>
<pre class="example" title="Disallowing all touch behaviors">
&lt;div style=&quot;touch-action: none;&quot;&gt;
    This element receives pointer events for all touches.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="example" title="Allowing horizontal panning only">
&lt;div style=&quot;touch-action: pan-x;&quot;&gt;
    This element receives pointer events when not panning in the horizontal direction.
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<pre class="example" title="Child regions that disallow touch behaviors">
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow: auto;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;touch-action: none;&quot;&gt;
        This element receives pointer events for all touches.
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        Touches on this element MAY be consumed for manipulating the parent.
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;	
</pre>
<pre class="example" title="Intermediate parent that disallows touch behaviors">
&lt;div style=&quot;overflow: auto;&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div style=&quot;touch-action: pan-y;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;touch-action: pan-x;&quot;&gt;
            This element receives pointer events for all touches because it allows only horizontal panning yet an intermediate ancestor (between it an the pannable element) only allows horizontal panning. Therefore, no touch behaviors are allowed.
        &lt;/div&gt;

<h1><dfn title="Pointer Capture">Pointer Capture</dfn></h1>
	<div class="informative">
	<p>
	Pointer capture allows the events for a particular pointer to be retargeted to a particular element other than the normal hit-test result of the pointer's location. This is useful in scenarios like a custom slider control (e.g. similar to the [[HTML5]] <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> control). Pointer capture can be set on the slider thumb element, allowing the user to slide the control back and forth even if the pointer slides off of the thumb.</p>
	<figure>
		<img src="slider.png" alt="Custom Volume Slider">
		<figcaption>Example of a custom slider control that chooses a value by sliding the thumb element back and forth. After <code>pointerdown</code> on the thumb, pointer capture can be used to allow the user to slide the thumb even if the pointer drifts off of it.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</div>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Setting Pointer Capture</h2>
		Pointer capture is set on an element by calling the <code>element.setPointerCapture(pointerId)</code> method. When this method is called, a user agent MUST run the following steps:
		<ol>
			<li>If the <code>pointerId</code> provided as the method's argument does not match any of the <a title="active pointer" class="internalDFN">active pointers</a>, then throw a <code>DOMException</code> with the name <code>InvalidPointerId</code>.</li>
			<li>If the pointer is not in the <a title="active buttons state" class="internalDFN">active buttons</a> state, then terminate these steps.</li>
			<li>Until pointer capture is released, set the <code>target</code> property of all future pointer and compatibility mouse events for the specified <code>pointerId</code> to the <code>Element</code> on which this method was invoked.</li>
			<li>Until pointer capture is released, set the <code>relatedTarget</code> property of all future pointer and compatibility mouse events for the specified <code>pointerId</code> to <code>null</code>.</li>
			<li>Fire a <code>gotpointercapture</code> event at the <code>Element</code> on which this method was invoked.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Releasing Pointer Capture</h2>
		Pointer capture is released on an element explicitly by calling the <code>element.releasePointerCapture(pointerId)</code> method. When this method is called, a user agent MUST run the following steps:
		<ol>
			<li>If the <code>pointerId</code> provided as the method's argument does not match any of the <a title="active pointer" class="internalDFN">active pointers</a>, then throw a <code>DOMException</code> with the name <code>InvalidPointerId</code>.</li>
			<li>If pointer capture is not currently set for the specified pointer, then terminate these steps.</li>
			<li>For all future pointer and compatibility mouse events for the specified <code>pointerId</code>, resume setting the <code>target</code> property to the hit-test results (out of scope for this specification) for the pointer.</li>
			<li>Fire a <code>lostpointercapture</code> event at the <code>Element</code> on which this method was invoked.</li>
		</ol>
	</section>
	<section>
		<h2>Implicit Release of Pointer Capture</h2>
		Immediately after firing the <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code> events, a user agent MUST run the steps as if the <code>releasePointerCapture()</code> method has been called with an argument equal to the <code>pointerId</code> property of the <code>pointerup</code> or<code>pointercancel</code> event just dispatched.

<section>
		<h1><dfn title="compatibility mouse events">Compatibility Mapping with Mouse Events</dfn></h1>
		<div><p>The vast majority of web content existing today codes only to Mouse Events. The following describes the algorithm for how a user agent MAY map generic pointer input to mouse events for compatibility with this content. Unless otherwise noted, the target of any mapped mouse event MAY be the same as the target for the pointer event from which it was mapped.</p>
		<p>Authors can prevent the production of compatibility mouse events by cancelling the <code>pointerdown</code> event. </p>
		<p>The compatibility mapping with mouse events are an OPTIONAL feature of this specification. User agents are encouraged to support the feature for best compatibility with existing legacy content. User agents that do not support compatibility mouse events are still encouraged to support the <code>click</code> event (see the note below).</p>
		<section class="note">
			<p>The <code>click</code> event is defined in [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] and is not considered a <a title="compatibility mouse events" class="internalDFN" href="#dfn-compatibility-mouse-events">compatibility mouse event</a> as it is typically tied to user interface activation.</p>
			<p>In user agents that support firing <code>click</code>, calling <code>preventDefault</code> during a pointer event typically does not have an effect on whether <code>click</code> is fired or not.  Because it is not a compatibility mouse event, user agents typically fire <code>click</code> for all pointing devices, including pointers that are not primary pointers.
		</section>
		</div>
		<section>
			<h2>Mapping for devices that support hover</h2>
			<div>Whenever a user agent is to dispatch a pointer event from for device that supports hover, it MAY run the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>If the <code>isPrimary</code> property for the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>false</code> then dispatch the pointer event and terminate these steps.</li>
					<li>Dispatch the pointer event.</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerdown</code> and the event was <a title="cancelled event" class="internalDFN">cancelled</a>, then set the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was: 
						<ul>
							<li><code>pointerover</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseover</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerout</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseout</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerenter</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseenter</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerleave</code>, then dispatch a <code>pointerleave</code> event.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag is <b>not</b> set for this <code>pointerType</code> and the pointer event dispatched was:
						<ul>
							<li><code>pointerdown</code>, then dispatch a <code>mousedown</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointermove</code>, then dispatch a <code>mousemove</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerup</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseup</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointercancel</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseup</code> event <b>at the <code>window</code>.</b></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code>, clear the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<section class="note">Mouse events can only be prevented when the pointer is down.  Hovering pointers (e.g. a mouse with no buttons pressed) cannot have their mouse events prevented. And, the <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code> events are never prevented (even if the pointer is down).</section>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>Mapping for devices that do not support hover</h2>
			<div>Some devices, such as most touchscreens, do not support hovering a coordinate (or set of coordinates) while not in the active state. Much existing content coded to mouse events assumes that a mouse is producing the events and thus certain qualities are generally true:
			<ul>
				<li>The input can hover independently of activation (e.g. moving a mouse cursor without any buttons pressed)</li>
				<li>The input will likely produce the <code>mousemove</code> event on an element before clicking it</li>
			</ul>
			This requires that user agents provide a different mapping for these types of input devices. Whenever a user agent is to dispatch a pointer event from a device that does not support hover, it MAY run the following steps:
				<ol>
					<li>If the <code>isPrimary</code> property for the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>false</code> then dispatch the pointer event and terminate these steps.</li>
					<li>If the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>pointerover</code> and the <code>pointerdown</code> event has not yet been dispatched for this pointer, then dispatch a <code>mousemove</code> event.</li>
					<li>Dispatch the pointer event.</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerdown</code> and the event was <a title="cancelled event" class="internalDFN">cancelled</a>, then set the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was: 
						<ul>
							<li><code>pointerover</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseover</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerout</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseout</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerenter</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseenter</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerleave</code>, then dispatch a <code>pointerleave</code> event.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>					<li>If the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag is <b>not</b> set for this <code>pointerType</code> and the pointer event dispatched was:
						<ul>
							<li><code>pointerdown</code>, then dispatch a <code>mousedown</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointermove</code>, then dispatch a <code>mousemove</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointerup</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseup</code> event.</li>
							<li><code>pointercancel</code>, then dispatch a <code>mouseup</code> event <b>at the <code>window</code>.</b></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code>, clear the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>

		<h1>Glossary</h1>
		<dl>
			<dt><dfn>active buttons state</dfn></dt>
				<dd>The condition when a pointer has a non-zero value for the <code>buttons</code> property. For mouse, this is when the device has at least one button depressed. For touch, this is when there is physical contact with the digitizer. For pen, this is when the pen has physical contact with the digitizer.</dd> 
			<dt><dfn>active pointer</dfn></dt>
				<dd>Any touch contact, pen stylus, mouse cursor, or other pointer that can produce events.  If it is possible for a given pointer (identified by a unique <code>pointerId</code>) to produce additional events, then that pointer is still considered active. Examples:
					<ul>
						<li>A mouse connected to the device is always active.</li>
						<li>A touch contact on the screen is considered active.</li>
						<li>If a touch contact or pen stylus is lifted beyond the range of the digitizer, then it is no longer considered active.</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="note">In some platforms, the set of active pointers includes all pointer input to the device, including any that are not targeted at the user agent (e.g. another application).</div>
				</dd>
			<dt><dfn>cancelled event</dfn></dt>
				<dd>An event whose default action was prevented by means of <code>preventDefault()</code>, returning <code>false</code> in an event handler, or other means as defined by [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] and [[!HTML5]].</dd>
			<dt><dfn>contact geometry</dfn></dt>
				<dd>The bounding box of an input (most commonly, touch) on a digitizer. This typically refers to devices with coarser pointer input resolution than a single pixel. Some devices do not report this data at all.</dd>
			<dt><dfn>digitizer</dfn></dt>
				<dd>A type of input sensing device in which a surface can detect input which is in contact and/or in close proximity. Most commonly, this is the surface that sense input from touch contact or a pen stylus.</dd>
