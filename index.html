        <p>The features in this specification extend or modify those found in Pointer Events, a W3C Recommendation that describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. For compatibility with existing mouse based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire Mouse Events for other pointer device types.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
        <p>This specification is an update to [[PointerEvents2]] which was shipped broadly by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.
           Level 3 includes editorial clarifications and new features that facilitate more use cases, in an effort to enable wider developer and browser adoption.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Today, most [[HTML]] content is used with and/or designed for mouse input. Those that handle input in a custom manner typically code to [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Events. Newer computing devices today, however, incorporate other forms of input, including touchscreens, pen input, etc. Event types have been proposed for handling each of these forms of input individually. However, that approach often incurs unnecessary duplication of logic and event handling overhead when adding support for a new input type. This often creates a compatibility problem when content is written with only one device type in mind. Additionally, for compatibility with existing mouse-based content, most <a data-lt="user agent">user agents</a> fire Mouse Events for all input types. This makes it ambiguous whether a Mouse Event represents an actual mouse device or is being produced from another input type for compatibility, which makes it hard to code to both device types simultaneously.</p>

        <p>To reduce the cost of coding to multiple input types and also to help with the above described ambiguity with Mouse Events, this specification defines a more abstract form of input, called a <a>pointer</a>. A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easier to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, this specification also defines properties for inspecting the device type which produced the event. The primary goal is to provide a single set of events and interfaces that allow for easier authoring for cross-device pointer input while still allowing for device-specific handling only when necessary for an augmented experience.</p>
        <p>An additional key goal is to enable multi-threaded user agents to handle <a>direct manipulation</a> actions for panning and zooming (for instance, with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen), without blocking on script execution.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>While this specification defines a unified event model for a variety of pointer inputs, this model does not cover other forms of input such as keyboards or keyboard-like interfaces (for instance, a screen reader or similar assistive technology running on a touchscreen-only device, which allows users sequential navigation through focusable controls and elements). While user agents might choose to also generate pointer events in response to these interfaces, this scenario is not covered in this specification.</p>

            <p>In the first instance, authors are encouraged to provide equivalent functionality for all forms of input by responding to high-level events such as <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code> and <code>click</code>. However, when using low-level events (such as Pointer Events), authors are encouraged to ensure that all types of input are supported. In the case of keyboards and keyboard-like interfaces, this might require the addition of explicit keyboard event handling. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#keyboard-accessible"><cite><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible</cite></a> [[WCAG21]] for further details.</p>

            <img src="images/pointer.png" alt="Pointer input combines input from mouse, pen, touch, etc.">
            <figcaption>A pointer is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The events for handling generic pointer input look a lot like those for mouse: {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerover}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerout}}, etc. This facilitates easy content migration from Mouse Events to Pointer Events.
        Pointer Events provide all the usual properties present in Mouse Events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. So authors can easily code to Pointer Events to share logic between different input types where it makes sense, and customize for a particular type of input only where necessary to get the best experience.</p>
        <p>While Pointer Events are sourced from a variety of input devices, they are not defined as being generated from some other set of device-specific events. While possible and encouraged for compatibility, this spec does not require other device-specific events be supported (e.g. mouse events, touch events, etc.). A user agent could support pointer events without supporting any other device events. For compatibility with content written to mouse-specific events, this specification does provide an optional section describing how to generate <a>compatibility mouse events</a> based on pointer input from devices other than a mouse.</p>

        <div class="note informative">
            <p>This specification does not provide any advice on the expected behavior of user agents that support both Touch Events (as defined in [[TOUCH-EVENTS]]) and Pointer Events. For more information on the relationship between these two specifications, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/">Touch Events Community Group</a>.</p>

                            <p>A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event. User agents MAY reserve a generic <code>pointerId</code> value of <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> for the primary mouse pointer. The <code>pointerId</code> value of <code>-1</code> MUST be reserved and used to indicate events that were generated by something other than a pointing device. For any other pointers, user agents are free to implement different strategies and approaches in how they assign a <code>pointerId</code> value. However, all <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> in the [=top-level browsing context=] (as defined by [[HTML]]) must be unique, and the identifier MUST NOT be influenced by any other top-level browsing context (i.e. one top-level browsing context cannot assume that the <code>pointerId</code> of a pointer will be the same when the pointer moves outside of the browsing context and into another top-level browsing context). The user agent MAY recycle previously retired values for <code>pointerId</code> from previous active pointers, or it MAY always reuse the same <code>pointerId</code> for a particular pointing device (for instance, to uniquely identify particular pen/stylus inputs from a specific user in a multi-user collaborative application). However, in the latter case, to minimize the chance of fingerprinting and tracking across different pages or domains, the <code>pointerId</code> MUST only be associated explicitly with that particular pointing device for the lifetime of the page / session, and a new randomized <code>pointerId</code> MUST be chosen the next time that particular pointing device is used again in a new session.</p>

                                <p>The <code>pointerId</code> selection algorithm is implementation specific. Therefore authors cannot assume values convey any particular meaning other than an identifier for the pointer that is unique from all other active pointers. As an example, user agents may simply assign a number, starting from <code>0</code>, to any active pointers, in the order that they become active — but these values are not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.</p>

                    <p>Some pointer devices, such as mouse or pen, support multiple buttons. In the [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Event model, each button press produces a <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event. To better abstract this hardware difference and simplify cross-device input authoring, Pointer Events do not fire overlapping {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} events for chorded button presses (depressing an additional button while another button on the pointer device is already depressed).</p>
                    <p>Instead, chorded button presses can be detected by inspecting changes to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties. The <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties are inherited from the {{MouseEvent}} interface, but with a change in semantics and values, as outlined in the following sections.</p>
                    <p>The modifications to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties apply only to pointer events. For any <a>compatibility mouse events</a> the value of <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> MUST follow [[UIEVENTS]].</p>

                <h2>The <dfn>primary pointer</dfn></h2>
                <p>In a multi-pointer (e.g. multi-touch) scenario, the <code>isPrimary</code> property is used to identify a master pointer amongst the set of <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> for each pointer type.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At any given time, there can only ever be at most one primary pointer for each pointer type.</li>
                    <li>The first pointer to become active for a particular pointer type (e.g. the first finger to touch the screen in a multi-touch interaction) becomes the primary pointer for that pointer type.</li>
                    <li>Only a primary pointer will produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>. In the case where there are multiple <a>primary pointers</a>, these pointers will all produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note">Authors who desire single-pointer interaction can achieve this by ignoring non-primary pointers (however, see the note below on <a href="#multiple-primary-pointers">multiple primary pointers</a>).</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-primary-pointers">When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers (one for each <code>pointerType</code>) are considered primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will produce pointers that are both considered primary.</div>
                <div class="note">Some devices, operating systems and user agents may ignore the concurrent use of more than one type of pointer input to avoid accidental interactions. For instance, devices that support both touch and pen interactions may ignore touch inputs while the pen is actively being used, to allow users to rest their hand on the touchscreen while using the pen (a feature commonly referred to as "palm rejection"). Currently, it is not possible for authors to suppress this behavior.</div>
                <div class="note">In some cases, it is possible for the user agent to fire pointer events in which no pointer is marked as a primary pointer. For instance, when there are multiple active pointers of a particular type, like a multi-touch interaction, and the primary pointer is removed (e.g. it leaves the screen), there may end up being no primary pointers. Also on platforms where the primary pointer is determined using all active pointers of the same type on the device (including those targeted at an application other than the user agent), if the first (primary) pointer is outside of the user agent and other (non-primary) pointers targeted inside the user agent, then the user agent may fire pointer events for the other pointers with a value of <code>false</code> for <code>isPrimary</code>.</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-mouse-inputs">Current operating systems and user agents don't usually have a concept of multiple mouse inputs. When more than one mouse device is present (for instance, on a laptop with both a trackpad and an external mouse), all mouse devices are generally treated as a single device — movements on any of the devices are translated to movement of a single mouse pointer, and there is no distinction between button presses on different mouse devices. For this reason, there will usually only be a single mouse pointer, and that pointer will be primary.</div>

                <p>To <dfn>fire a pointer event</dfn> named |e| means to [=fire an event=] named |e| using <a>PointerEvent</a> whose attributes are set as defined in {{PointerEvent}} Interface and <a>Attributes and Default Actions</a>.</p>
                <p>If the event is not {{GlobalEventHandlers/gotpointercapture}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}}, run the <a>process pending pointer capture</a> steps for this <code>PointerEvent</code>.

                <p>The target object at which the event is fired is determined as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <a>pointer capture target override</a> has been set for the pointer, set the target to <a>pointer capture target override</a> object.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, set the target to the object returned by normal <a>hit test</a> mechanisms (out of scope for this specification).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let |targetDocument| be target's [=Node/node document=] [[DOM]].

                <p>If the event is {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}, or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} set <a>active document</a> for the event's <code>pointerId</code> to |targetDocument|.</p>

                <p>If the event is {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}, the associated device is a direct manipulation device, and the target is an {{Element}},
                   then <a>set pointer capture</a> for this <code>pointerId</code> to the target element as described in <a>implicit pointer capture</a>.

                <p>Fire the event to the determined target. The user agent SHOULD treat the target as if the pointing device has moved over it for the purpose of <a data-cite="uievents/#events-mouseevent-event-order">ensuring event ordering</a> [[UIEVENTS]].</p>

                <div class="note">Using the <a>pointer capture target override</a> as the target instead of the normal hit-test result may fire some boundary events, as defined by [[UIEVENTS]].

                        <p>Viewport manipulations (panning and zooming) — generally, as a result of a <a>direct manipulation</a> interaction — are intentionally NOT a default action of pointer events, meaning that these behaviors (e.g. panning a page as a result of moving a finger on a touchscreen) cannot be suppressed by canceling a pointer event. Authors must instead use <code>touch-action</code> to explicitly <a>declare the direct manipulation behavior</a> for a region of the document. Removing this dependency on the cancelation of events facilitates performance optimizations by the user agent.</p>

                  <p>For {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerenter}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerleave}} events, the {{EventInit/composed}} [[DOM]] attribute SHOULD be <code>false</code>; for all other pointer events in the table above, the attribute SHOULD be <code>true</code>.</p>

                  <p>For all pointer events in the table above, the {{UIEvent/detail}} [[UIEVENTS]] attribute SHOULD be 0.</p>
                        <div class="note">Many user agents expose non-standard attributes <code>fromElement</code> and <code>toElement</code> in MouseEvents to support legacy content. We encourage those user agents to set the values of those (inherited) attributes in PointerEvents to <code>null</code> to transition authors to the use of standardized alternates (i.e. <code>target</code> and <code>relatedTarget</code>).</div>
                        <p>Similar to <code>MouseEvent</code> {{MouseEventInit/relatedTarget}}, the <code>relatedTarget</code> should be initialized to the element whose bounds the pointer just left (in the case of a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerover}} or <code>pointerenter</code> event) or the element whose bounds the pointer is entering (in the case of a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerout}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerleave}}). For other pointer events, this value will default to null. Note that when an element receives the pointer capture all the following events for that pointer are considered to be inside the boundary of the capturing element.</p>
                        <p>For {{GlobalEventHandlers/gotpointercapture}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}} all the attributes except the ones defined in the table above should be the same as the Pointer Event that caused the user agent to run the <a>process pending pointer capture</a> steps and fire the {{GlobalEventHandlers/gotpointercapture}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}} events.</p>

                    <p>The user agent MUST <dfn>suppress a pointer event stream</dfn> when it detects that a pointer is unlikely to continue to produce events.  Any of the following scenarios satisfy this condition (there MAY be additional scenarios):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The user agent has opened a modal dialog or menu.</li>
                        <li>A pointer input device is physically disconnected, or a hoverable pointer input device (e.g. a hoverable pen/stylus) has left the hover range detectable by the digitizer.</li>
                        <li>The pointer is subsequently used by the user agent to manipulate the page viewport (e.g. panning or zooming).  See the section on <a>touch-action</a> CSS property for details.
                            <div class="note">User agents can trigger panning or zooming through multiple pointer types (such as touch and pen), and therefore the start of a pan or zoom action may result in the suppression of various pointers, including pointers with different pointer types.</div>

                        <li>As part of the drag operation initiation algorithm as defined in the <a data-cite="html/#drag-and-drop-processing-model">drag and drop processing model</a> [[HTML]],

                    </ul>
                    <div class="note">
                        <p>Other scenarios in which the user agent MAY <a>suppress a pointer event stream</a> include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A device's screen orientation is changed while a pointer is active.</li>

                            <li>The user agent interprets the input as accidental (for example, the hardware supports palm rejection).</li>

Also note that while a pointer is captured it is considered to be always inside the boundaries of the capturing element for the purpose of firing boundary events.

                <div class="note">There are similarities between this event type, the <code>mouseenter</code> event described in [[UIEVENTS]], and the CSS <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class described in [[CSS21]]. See also the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerleave}} event.</div>

                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} when a pointer enters the <a>active buttons state</a>. For mouse, this is when the device transitions from no buttons depressed to at least one button depressed. For touch, this is when physical contact is made with the <a>digitizer</a>. For pen, this is when the pen either makes physical contact with the digitizer without any button depressed, or transitions from no buttons depressed to at least one button depressed while hovering.</p>
                <div class="note">For mouse (or other multi-button pointer devices), this means {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} are not fired for all of the same circumstances as <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code>.

                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire
                {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} events. This includes any changes to coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure,
                tilt, twist, contact geometry (i.e. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>) or <a>chorded buttons</a>.</p>
                <p>User agents MAY delay dispatch of the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event (for instance, for performance reasons).
                The <a>coalesced events</a> information will be exposed via the <a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents"><code>getCoalescedEvents()</code></a> method for the single dispatched {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event.
                The final coordinates of such events should be used for finding the target of the event.</p>

                <h3>The <dfn data-dfn-for="GlobalEventHandlers" data-dfn-type="event">pointerrawupdate</dfn> event</h3>
                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a>
                named {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}}, and only do so within a [=secure context=], when a pointer changes any properties that don't fire
                <code>pointerdown</code> or <code>pointerup</code> events.  See <code>pointermove</code> event for a list of such properties.</p>
                <p>In contrast with {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}, user agents SHOULD dispatch {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} events as soon as possible
                and as frequently as the JavaScript can handle the events.</p>
                <p>The <code>target</code> of {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} events might be different from the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} events
                due to the fact that {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} events might get delayed or coalesced, and the final position of the event
                which is used for finding the <code>target</code> could be different from its coalesced events.</p>
                <p>Note that if there is already another {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} with the same <code>pointerId</code> that hasn't been dispatched
                in the [=event loop=], the
                user agent MAY coalesce the new {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} with that event instead of creating a new [=task=].
                This may cause {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} to have coalesced events, and
                they will all be delivered as <a>coalesced events</a> of one {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} event as soon as
                the event is processed in the [=event loop=].
                See <a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents"><code>getCoalescedEvents()</code></a> for more information.</p>
                <p>In terms of ordering of {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}},
                if the user agent received an update from the platform that causes both {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} and {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} events,
                then the user agent MUST dispatch the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} event before the corresponding {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}.</p>
                <p>Other than the <code>target</code>, the concatenation of coalesced events lists of all dispatched {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} events
                since the last {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event is the same as the coalesced events of the next {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event in terms of the other event attributes.
                The attributes of {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} are mostly the same as {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}, with the exception of
                <code>cancelable</code> which MUST be false for {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}}.</p>
                <p>User agents SHOULD not fire <a>compatibility mouse events</a> for {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}}.</p>
                <div class="note">Adding listeners for the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} event might negatively impact the performance of the web page, depending on the implementation of the user agent.
                For most use cases the other pointerevent types should suffice.
                A {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} listener should only be added if JavaScript needs high frequency events and can handle them just as fast.
                In these cases, there is probably no need to listen to other types of pointer events.</div>

                   <p>For these events, all <code>PointerEvent</code> specific attributes (defined in this spec) other than <code>pointerId</code> and <code>pointerType</code> will have their default values. In addition:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>If the events are generated by a pointing device, their <code>pointerId</code> and <code>pointerType</code> MUST be the same as the PointerEvents that caused these events.</li>
                       <li>If the events are generated by a non-pointing device (such as voice recognition software or a keyboard interaction), <code>pointerId</code> MUST be <code>-1</code> and <code>pointerType</code> MUST be an empty string.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>As noted in {{PointerEvent}}, [[[CSSOM-VIEW]]] proposes to redefine the various coordinate properties (<code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, <code>pageX</code>, <code>pageY</code>, <code>clientX</code>,
                   <code>clientY</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>offsetX</code>, <code>offsetY</code>) as <code>double</code>, to allow for fractional coordinates.
                   However, this change — when applied only to {{PointerEvent}}, but not to regular {{MouseEvent}} — has proven to lead to web compatibility issues with legacy code
                   in the case of <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, and <code>contextmenu</code>. For this reason, user agents that have implemented the proposed
                   change in [[[CSSOM-VIEW]]] only for {{PointerEvent}} MUST convert the various coordinate properties for the <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, and <code>contextmenu</code>
                   to <code>long</code> values (as defined in the original [[[UIEVENTS]]]) using <a data-cite="ECMASCRIPT#sec-math.floor">Math.floor</a> [[ECMASCRIPT]].</p>

        <h1><dfn data-lt="direct manipulation behavior|declare the direct manipulation behavior">Declaring direct manipulation behavior</dfn></h1>
        <p>As noted in <a>Attributes and Default Actions</a>, viewport manipulations (panning and zooming) cannot be suppressed by canceling a pointer event. Instead, authors must declaratively define which of these behaviors they want to allow, and which they want to suppress, using the <code>touch-action</code> CSS property.</p>
        <div class="note">While the issue of pointers used to manipulate the viewport is generally limited to touch input (where a user's finger can both interact with content and pan/zoom the page), certain user agents may also allow the same types of (direct or indirect) manipulation for other pointer types. For instance, on mobile/tablet devices, users may also be able to scroll using a stylus. While, for historical reasons, the <code>touch-action</code> CSS property defined in this specification appears to refer only to touch inputs, it does in fact apply to all forms of pointer inputs that allow <a>direct manipulation</a> for panning and zooming.</div>
        <section>
            <h2>The <dfn><code>touch-action</code></dfn> CSS property</h2>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr><th>Name:</th><td><code>touch-action</code></td></tr>
                <tr><th>Value:</th><td><code>auto</code> | <code>none</code> | [ [ <code>pan-x</code> | <code>pan-left</code> | <code>pan-right</code> ] || [ <code>pan-y</code> | <code>pan-up</code> | <code>pan-down</code> ] ] | <code>manipulation</code></td></tr>

                <tr><th>Computed value:</th><td>Same as specified value.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>The <code>touch-action</code> CSS property determines whether <a>direct manipulation</a> interactions (which are not limited to touch, despite the property's name) MAY trigger the user agent's panning and zooming behavior. See the section on <a><code>touch-action</code> values</a>.</p>

            <p>Right before starting to pan or zoom, the user agent MUST <a>suppress a pointer event stream</a> if all of the following conditions are true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user agent has determined (via methods out of scope for this specification) that a direct manipulation interaction is to be consumed for panning or zooming,</li>
                <li>a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} event has been sent for the pointer, and</li>
                <li>a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointercancel}} event (following the above mentioned {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}) has not yet been sent for the pointer.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">Some user agents implement complex gestures for behaviors that involve a series of separate discrete gestures, but which are all treated as part of a single continuous gesture. For example, consider a "fling to scroll" gesture on a touchscreen: a user starts panning the document with a rapid finger movement, lifts the finger from the touchscreen, and the document continues panning with simulated inertia. While the document is still moving, the user may place their finger on the touchscreen and execute another "fling" to provide further momentum for the panning, or counteract the current panning to slow it down, stop panning altogether, or reverse the direction of the panning. As this specification does not normatively define how gestures and behaviors are implemented, it is left up to the user agent to decide whether or not the second touch (before it is interpreted as a second "fling" or counteraction of the current panning) fires pointer events or not.</div>

            <div class="note"><code>touch-action</code> does not apply/cascade through to embedded browsing contexts. For instance, even applying <code>touch-action</code> to an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> won't have any effect on the behavior of direct manipulation interactions for panning and zooming within the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> itself.</div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Determining supported direct manipulation behavior</h2>
          <p>When a user interacts with an element using a <a>direct manipulation</a> pointer (such as touch or stylus on a touchscreen), the effect of that input is determined by the value of the <code>touch-action</code> property, and the default direct manipulation behaviors of the element and its ancestors, as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A direct manipulation interaction for panning and zooming <dfn data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms to an element's <code>touch-action</code></dfn> if the behavior is allowed in the coordinate space of the element. Note that if CSS transforms have been applied, the element's coordinate space may differ from the screen coordinate in a way that affects the conformity here; for example, the X axis of an element rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the screen will be parallel to the Y-axis of the screen coordinate.</li>
            <li>A direct manipulation interaction for panning is supported if it <a data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms</a> to the <code>touch-action</code> property of each element between the hit tested element and its nearest inclusive ancestor that is a [=scroll container=] (as defined in [[CSS-OVERFLOW-3]]).</li>
            <li>A direct manipulation interaction for zooming is supported if it <a data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms</a> to the <code>touch-action</code> property of each element between the hit tested element and the <code>document</code> element of the [=top-level browsing context=] (as defined in [[HTML]]).</li>
            <li>Once panning or zooming has been started, and the user agent has already determined whether or not the gesture should be handled as a user agent direct manipulation behavior, any changes to the relevant <code>touch-action</code> value will be ignored for the duration of the action. For instance, programmatically changing the <code>touch-action</code> value for an element from <code>auto</code> to <code>none</code> as part of a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} handler script will not result in the user agent aborting or suppressing any of the pan or zoom behavior for that input for as long as that pointer is active.</li>
            <li>Similarly, in the case of the various <code>touch-action</code> values of <code>pan-*</code>, once the user agent has determined whether to handle a gesture directly or not at the start of the gesture, a subsequent change in the direction of the same gesture SHOULD be ignored by the user agent for as long as that pointer is active. For instance, if an element has been set to <code>touch-action: pan-y</code> (meaning that only vertical panning is handled by the user agent), and a touch gesture starts off horizontally, no vertical panning should occur if the user changes the direction of their gesture to be vertical while their finger is still touching the screen.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="note">Some user agents support panning and zooming interactions involving multiple concurrent pointers (e.g. multi-touch). Methods for processing or associating the <code>touch-action</code> values of multiple concurrent pointers is out of scope for this specification.</div>

          <div class="note">The terms "panning" and "scrolling" are considered synonymous (or, more aptly, "panning" is "scrolling" using a direct manipulation input).

            <dt>manipulation</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY consider direct manipulation interactions that begin on the element only for the purposes of panning and <strong>continuous</strong> zooming (such as pinch-zoom), but MUST NOT trigger other related behaviors that rely on multiple activations that must happen within a set period of time (such as double-tap to zoom, or double-tap and hold for single-finger zoom).</dd>
          </dl>
          <div class="note"><a data-cite="compat/#touch-action">Additional <code>touch-action</code> values</a> common in implementations are defined in [[COMPAT]].</div>
          <div class="note">The <code>touch-action</code> property only applies to elements that support both the CSS <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties (see [[CSS21]]). This restriction is designed to facilitate user agent optimizations for <em>low-latency</em> <a>direct manipulation</a> panning and zooming. For elements not supported by default, such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> which is a <em>non-replaced inline element</em>, authors can set the <code>display</code> CSS property to a value, such as <code>block</code>, that supports <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Future specifications could extend this API to all elements.</div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>The direction-specific pan values are useful for customizing some overscroll behaviors.
               For example, to implement a simple pull-to-refresh effect the document's <code>touch-action</code> can be set to <code>pan-x pan-down</code> whenever the scroll position is 0 and <code>pan-x pan-y</code> otherwise.
               This allows pointer event handlers to define the behavior for upward panning/scrolling that start from the top of the document.</p>
            <p>The direction-specific pan values can also be used for composing a component that implements custom panning with pointer event handling within an element that scrolls natively (or vice-versa).
               For example, an image carousel may use <code>pan-y</code> to ensure it receives pointer events for any horizontal pan operations without interfering with vertical panning of the document.
               When the carousel reaches its right-most extent, it may change its <code>touch-action</code> to <code>pan-y pan-right</code> so that a subsequent scroll operation beyond its extent can scroll the document within the viewport if possible.
               It's not possible to change the behavior of a panning/scrolling operation while it is taking place.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">Disabling some default direct manipulation behaviors for panning and zooming may allow user agents to respond to other behaviors more quickly. For example, with <code>auto</code> user agents typically add 300ms of delay before <code>click</code> to allow for double-tap gestures to be handled. In these cases, explicitly setting <code>touch-action: none</code> or <code>touch-action: manipulation</code> will remove this delay. Note that the methods for determining a tap or double-tap gesture are out of scope for this specification.</div>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pointer capture allows the events for a particular pointer (including any <a>compatibility mouse events</a>) to be retargeted to a particular element other than the normal <a>hit test</a> result of the pointer's location. This is useful in scenarios like a custom slider control (e.g. similar to the [[HTML]] <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> control). Pointer capture can be set on the slider thumb element, allowing the user to slide the control back and forth even if the pointer slides off of the thumb.</p>

            <h2><dfn data-lt="set pointer capture">Setting pointer capture</dfn></h2>
            <p>Pointer capture is set on an |element| of type {{Element}} by calling the <code>element.setPointerCapture(pointerId)</code> method.
               When this method is invoked, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the <code>pointerId</code> provided as the method's argument does not match any of the <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a>, then [=exception/throw=] a {{"NotFoundError"}} {{DOMException}}.</li>
                <li>Let the |pointer| be the <a>active pointer</a> specified by the given <code>pointerId</code>.
                <li>If the |element| is not [=connected=] [[DOM]], [=exception/throw=] an {{"InvalidStateError"}} {{DOMException}}.</li>
                <li>If this method is invoked while the |element|'s [=Node/node document=] [[DOM]] has a locked element ([[PointerLock]] {{DocumentOrShadowRoot/pointerLockElement}}),
                    [=exception/throw=] an {{"InvalidStateError"}} {{DOMException}}.</li>
                <li>If the |pointer| is not in the <a>active buttons state</a> or
                    the |element|'s [=Node/node document=] is not the <a>active document</a> of the |pointer|, then terminate these steps.</li>
                <li>For the specified <code>pointerId</code>, set the <dfn>pending pointer capture target override</dfn> to the {{Element}} on which this method was invoked.</li>

            <h2><dfn data-lt="release pointer capture">Releasing pointer capture</dfn></h2>
            <p>Pointer capture is released on an element explicitly by calling the <code>element.releasePointerCapture(pointerId)</code> method. When this method is called, the user agent MUST run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the <code>pointerId</code> provided as the method's argument does not match any of the <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> and these steps are not being invoked as a result of the <a>implicit release of pointer capture</a>, then [=exception/throw=] a {{"NotFoundError"}} {{DOMException}}.</li>
                <li>If <a data-lt="Element.hasPointerCapture">hasPointerCapture</a> is false for the {{Element}} with the specified <code>pointerId</code>, then terminate these steps.</li>
                <li>For the specified <code>pointerId</code>, clear the <a>pending pointer capture target override</a>, if set.</li>
            </ol>

        <section>
            <h2><dfn>Implicit pointer capture</dfn></h2>
            <p>Inputs that implement <a>direct manipulation</a> interactions for panning and zooming (such as touch or stylus on a touchscreen) SHOULD behave exactly as if <a data-lt="Element.setPointerCapture">setPointerCapture()</a> was called on the target element just before the invocation of any {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} listeners. The <a data-lt="Element.hasPointerCapture">hasPointerCapture</a> API may be used (eg. within any {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} listener) to determine whether this has occurred. If <a data-lt="Element.releasePointerCapture">releasePointerCapture()</a> is not called for the pointer before the next pointer event is fired, then a {{GlobalEventHandlers/gotpointercapture}} event will be dispatched to the target (as normal) indicating that capture is active.</p>
            <div class="note">This is a breaking change from [[PointerEvents]], but does not impact the vast majority of existing content. In addition to matching typical platform UX conventions, this design for implicit capture enables user agents to make a performance optimization which prevents the need to invoke hit-testing on touch movement events without explicit developer opt-in (consistent with the performance properties of existing dominant native and web APIs for touch input).</div>
            <div class="note">In addition, user agents may implement implicit pointer capture behavior for all input devices on specific UI widgets such as input range controls (allowing some finger movement to stray outside of the form control itself during the interaction).</div>

            <p>Immediately after firing the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointercancel}} events,
               the user agent MUST clear the <a>pending pointer capture target override</a>
               for the <code>pointerId</code> of the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointercancel}} event that was just dispatched,
               and then run <a>process pending pointer capture</a> steps to fire {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}} if necessary.
               After running <a>process pending pointer capture</a> steps,
               if the pointer supports hover, user agent MUST also send corresponding boundary events necessary
               to reflect the current position of the pointer with no capture.</p>
            <p>If the user agent supports firing the <code>click</code> or <code>auxclick</code> event,
               and if in an implicit release scenario both that (<code>click</code> or <code>auxclick</code>)
               event and a {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}} event are fired,
               the <code>click</code> or <code>auxclick</code> event SHOULD be fired before {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}}.</p>
            <p>When the <a>pointer capture target override</a> is no longer [=connected=] [[DOM]],
               the <a>pending pointer capture target override</a> and <a>pointer capture target override</a> nodes SHOULD be cleared
               and also a PointerEvent named {{GlobalEventHandlers/lostpointercapture}} corresponding to the captured pointer SHOULD be fired at the document.</p>
            <p>When a pointer lock [[PointerLock]] is successfully applied on an element, the user agent MUST run the steps as if the <a data-lt='Element.releasePointerCapture'>releasePointerCapture()</a> method has been called if any element is set to be captured or pending to be captured.

        <h1>Coalesced and predicted events</h1>

        <div class="note">This specification does not define how user agents should coalesce or
        predict pointer movement data. It only specifies the API for accessing this information.</div>

        <section>
            <h2><dfn>Coalesced events</dfn></h2>

            <p>For performance reasons, user agents may choose not to send a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}}
            event every time a <a data-lt="measurable properties">measurable property</a>
            (such as coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or contact geometry)
            of a pointer is updated. Instead, they may coalesce (combine/merge) multiple changes into
            a single {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} event. While
            this approach helps in reducing the amount of event handling the user agent must perform,
            it will naturally reduce the granularity and fidelity when tracking a pointer position,
            particularly for fast and large movements. Using the
            <a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents"><code>getCoalescedEvents()</code></a> method
            it is possible for applications to access the raw, un-coalesced position changes. These
            allow for a more precise handling of pointer movement data. In the case of drawing
            applications, for instance, the un-coalesced events can be used to draw smoother curves that
            more closely match the actual movement of a pointer.</p>

            <figure id="figure_coalesced">
                <img src="images/coalesced-points.png" alt="Close-up view of a curve, showing coalesced and un-coalesced points">
                <figcaption>Example of a curve in a drawing application — using only the coalesced
                coordinates from {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} events (the grey dots), the curve is noticeably
                angular and jagged; the same line drawn using the more granular points provided by
                <code>getCoalescedEvents()</code> (the red circles) results in a smoother approximation
                of the pointer movement.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>A <a>PointerEvent</a> has an associated <dfn>coalesced events list</dfn> (a list of
            zero or more <code>PointerEvent</code>s). For trusted {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} and
            {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} events, the list is a sequence of all <code>PointerEvent</code>s
            that were coalesced into this event. The "parent" trusted {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} and
            {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerrawupdate}} event represents an accumulation of these coalesced events,
            but may have additional processing (for example to align with the display refresh rate).
            As a result, the coalesced events lists for these events always contain at least one event.
            For all other trusted event types, it is an empty list. Untrusted events have their
            <a>coalesced events list</a> initialized to the value passed to the constructor.</p>

            <div class="note">Since a trusted parent event is a summary or aggregation of the
            coalesced events, developers should only need to process either the parent events
            or all of the coalesced events, but not both.
            </div>

            <p>The events in the coalesced events list of a trusted event will have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monotonically increasing {{Event/timeStamp}} values [[DOM]] — all coalesced events have a
                    {{Event/timeStamp}} that is smaller than or equal to the {{Event/timeStamp}} of the dispatched pointer event that the
                    <a data-lt="PointerEvent.getPredictedEvents"><code>getCoalescedEvents()</code></a> method was called on. The coalesced events list
                    MUST be chronologically sorted by {{Event/timeStamp}}, so the first event will have the smallest {{Event/timeStamp}}.</li>
                <li>The same <code>pointerId</code>, <code>pointerType</code>, and <code>isPrimary</code> as the dispatched
                    "parent" pointer event.</li>

            <p>Some user agents have built-in algorithms which, after a series of confirmed pointer movements,
            can make a prediction (based on past points, and the speed/trajectory of the movement) what
            the position of future pointer movements may be. Applications can use this information with
            the <a data-lt="PointerEvent.getPredictedEvents"><code>getPredictedEvents()</code></a> method to speculatively "draw ahead" to a predicted position
            to reduce perceived latency, and then discarding these predicted points once the actual points

        <h1><dfn data-lt="compatibility mouse events">Compatibility mapping with mouse events</dfn></h1>
        <p>The vast majority of web content existing today codes only to Mouse Events. The following describes an algorithm for how the user agent MAY map generic pointer input to mouse events for compatibility with this content.</p>
        <p>The compatibility mapping with mouse events is an OPTIONAL feature of this specification. User agents are encouraged to support the feature for best compatibility with existing legacy content.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>At a high level, compatibility mouse events are intended to be "interleaved" with their respective pointer events. However, this specific order is not mandatory, and user agents that implement compatibility mouse events MAY decide to delay or group the dispatch of mouse events, as long as their relative order is consistent.</p>
            <p>Particularly in the case of touchscreen inputs, user agents MAY apply additional heuristics for gesture recognition (unless explicitly suppressed by authors through <a><code>touch-action</code></a>). During a sequence of events between a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} event and a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} event, the gesture recognition may have to wait until the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} event to detect or ignore a gesture. As a result the compatibility mouse events for the whole sequence may be dispatched together after the last {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} event, if the user agent determined that an interaction was not intended as a particular gesture. These specifics of user agent gesture recognition are not defined in this specification, and they may differ between implementations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Regardless of their support for compatibility mouse events, the user agents MUST always support the <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> events because these events are of type <code>PointerEvent</code> and are therefore not <a>compatibility mouse events</a>. Calling <code>preventDefault</code> during a pointer event MUST NOT have an effect on whether <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, or <code>contextmenu</code> are fired or not.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>The relative order of some of these high-level events (<code>contextmenu</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, etc.) with pointer events is undefined and varies between user agents. For example, in some user agents <code>contextmenu</code> will often follow a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}}, while in others it'll often precede a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointercancel}}, and in some situations it may be fired without any corresponding pointer event (for instance, as a result of a keyboard interaction).</p>
            <p>In addition, user agents may apply their own heuristics to determine whether or not a <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, or <code>contextmenu</code> event should be fired. Some user agents may choose not to fire these events if there are other (non-primary) pointers of the same type, or other primary pointers of a different type. User agents may determine that a particular action was not a "clean" tap, click, or long-press (for instance, if an interaction with a finger on a touch screen includes too much movement while the finger is in contact with the screen) and decide not to fire a <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, or <code>contextmenu</code> event. These aspects of user agent behavior are not defined in this specification, and they may differ between implementations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Unless otherwise noted, the target of any mapped mouse event SHOULD be the same target as the respective pointer event unless the target is no longer participating in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree. In this case, the mouse event should be fired at the original target's nearest ancestor node (at the time it was removed from the tree) that still participates in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree, meaning that a new event path (based on the new target node) is built for the mouse event.</p>
        <p>Authors can prevent the production of certain compatibility mouse events by canceling the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}} event.</p>
        <p>Mouse events can only be prevented when the pointer is down. Hovering pointers (e.g. a mouse with no buttons pressed) cannot have their mouse events prevented.</p>
        <p>The <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code>, and <code>mouseleave</code> events are never prevented (even if the pointer is down).</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Compatibility mouse events can't be prevented when a pointer event {{EventListener}} is set to be {{AddEventListenerOptions/passive}} [[DOM]].</p>

            <h2><dfn>Tracking the effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</dfn></h2>
            <p>While only <a>primary pointers</a> can produce compatibility mouse events, <a href="#multiple-primary-pointers">multiple primary pointers</a> can be active simultaneously, each producing its own compatibility mouse events. For compatibility with scripts relying on MouseEvents, the mouse transition events (<code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>) SHOULD simulate the movement of a <em>single</em> legacy mouse input. This means that the entry/exit state for every event target is valid, in accordance with [[UIEVENTS]]. Users agents SHOULD guarantee this by maintaining the <dfn>effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</dfn> in the document as follows.</p>
            <p>Right before firing a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event, or a {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerleave}} event at the <code>window</code>, the user agent SHOULD run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Let |T| be the target of the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerdown}}, {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerup}} or {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointermove}} event being dispatched. For the {{GlobalEventHandlers/pointerleave}} event, unset |T|.</li>
                <li>If |T| and current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> are both unset or they are equal, terminate these steps.</li>
                <li>Dispatch <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events as per [[UIEVENTS]] for a mouse moving from the current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> to |T|. Consider an unset value of either current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> or |T| as an out-of-window mouse position.</li>
                <li>Set <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> to |T|.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="note">
              <p> The <a>effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</a> models the fact that we cannot always have a direct mapping
                from pointer transition events (i.e., <code>pointerover</code>, <code>pointerout</code>, <code>pointerenter</code>
                and <code>pointerleave</code>) to corresponding legacy mouse transition events (i.e., <code>mouseover</code>,
                <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>).  The following animation illustrates a case
                where a user agent needs to dispatch more legacy mouse transition events than pointer transition events to be able to
                reconcile two primary pointers using a single legacy mouse input.</p>

              <figure id="legacy-pointer-transition">
                <video src="images/legacy-pointer-animation.webm" controls></video>
                <figcaption>
                  Simultaneous mouse pointer (white cursor) and touch pointer (white "hand" cursor) causing the single legacy mouse input
                  (orange cursor) to move between the two pointers.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>In this animation, note the time period between the mouse click and the touch tap.  Button 1 receives no
                <code>pointerout</code> event (because the "real" mouse pointer didn't leave the button rectangle within
                this period), but Button 1 receives a <code>mouseout</code> event when the <a>effective position of the
                legacy mouse pointer</a> moves to Button 2 on touch tap.  Similarly, in the time period between the touch
                tap and the moment before the mouse leaves Button 1, Button 1 receives no <code>pointerover</code> event
                for the same reason, but Button 1 receives a <code>mouseover</code> event when the <a>effective position
                of the legacy mouse pointer</a> moves back inside Button 1.</p>

            <h2>Mapping for devices that do not support hover</h2>
            <p>Some devices, such as most touchscreens, do not support hovering a coordinate (or set of coordinates) while not in the active state. Much existing content coded to mouse events assumes that a mouse is producing the events and thus certain qualities are generally true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The input can hover independently of activation (e.g. moving a mouse cursor without any buttons pressed).</li>
                <li>The input will likely produce the <code>mousemove</code> event on an element before clicking it.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">Hover is sometimes used to toggle the visibility of UI elements in content designed for mouse (e.g. "hover menus").

            <p>This requires that user agents provide a different mapping for these types of input devices. Whenever the user agent is to dispatch a pointer event for a device that <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>does not support hover</a>, it SHOULD run the following steps:</p>

        <h2>Converting between <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> and <code>altitudeAngle</code> / <code>azimuthAngle</code></h2>
        <p>Pointer Events include two complementary sets of attributes to express the orientation of a transducer relative to the X-Y plane:
            <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> (introduced in the original Pointer Events specification), and

        <p>Depending on the specific hardware and platform, user agents will likely only receive one set of values for the transducer orientation relative to the screen plane — either <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> or <code>altitudeAngle</code> / <code>azimuthAngle</code>. User agents MUST use the following algorithm for converting these values.</p>

        <p>This appendix discusses security and privacy considerations for Pointer Events implementations. The discussion is limited to security and privacy issues that arise directly from implementation of the event model, APIs and events defined in this specification.</p>
        <p>Many of the event types defined in this specification are dispatched in response to user actions. This allows malicious event listeners to gain access to information users would typically consider confidential, e.g., the exact path/movement of a user's mouse/stylus/finger while interacting with a page.</p>
        <p>Pointer events contain additional information (where supported by the user's device), such as the angle or tilt at which a pen input is held, the geometry of the contact surface, and the pressure exerted on the stylus or touch screen. Information about angle, tilt, geometry and pressure are directly related to sensors on the user's device, meaning that this specification allows an origin access to these sensors.</p>
        <p>This sensor data, as well as the ability to determine the type of input mechanism (mouse, touch, pen) used, may be used to infer characteristics of a user, or of the user's device and environment. These inferred characteristics and any device/environment information may themselves be sensitive — for instance, they may allow a malicious site to further infer if a user is using assistive technologies. This information can also be potentially used for the purposes of building a user profile and/or attempting to "fingerprint" and track a particular user.</p>
        <p>As mitigation, user agents may consider including the ability for users to disable access to particular sensor data (such as angle, tilt, pressure), and/or to make it available only after an explicit opt-in from the user.</p>
        <p>Beyond these considerations, the working group believes that this specification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not expose personally-identifiable information.</li>
            <li>Does not deal with high-value data.</li>
            <li>Does not introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions.</li>
            <li>Does not expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not expose any other data to an origin that it doesn’t currently have access to.</li>
            <li>Does not enable new script execution/loading mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to a user’s location.</li>
            <li>Does not require any special handling when the user agent is in "incognito" mode.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to other devices.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin control over a user agent’s native UI.</li>
            <li>Does not expose temporary identifiers to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts.</li>
            <li>Does not persist data to a user’s local device.</li>
            <li>Does not allow downgrading default security characteristics.</li>
        </ul>

        <dl>
            <dt><dfn>active buttons state</dfn></dt>
                <dd>The condition when a pointer has a non-zero value for the <code>buttons</code> property. For mouse, this is when the device has at least one button depressed. For touch, this is when there is physical contact with the digitizer. For pen, this is when either the pen has physical contact with the digitizer, or at least one button is depressed while hovering.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>active document</dfn></dt>
                <dd>For every <a>active pointer</a>, the document that received the last event from that pointer.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>active pointer</dfn></dt>
                <dd>Any touch contact, pen/stylus, mouse cursor, or other pointer that can produce events. If it is possible for a given pointer (identified by a unique <code>pointerId</code>) to produce additional events within the document, then that pointer is still considered active. Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A mouse connected to the device is always active.</li>
                        <li>A touch contact on the screen is considered active.</li>
                        <li>If a touch contact or pen/stylus is lifted beyond the range of the digitizer, then it is no longer considered active.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="note">On some platforms, the set of active pointers includes all pointer input to the device, including any that are not targeted at the user agent (e.g. those targeted at other applications).</div>
                </dd>
            <dt><dfn>canceled event</dfn></dt>
                <dd>An event whose default action was prevented by means of <code>preventDefault()</code>, returning <code>false</code> in an event handler, or other means as defined by [[UIEVENTS]] and [[HTML]].</dd>
            <dt><dfn>contact geometry</dfn></dt>
                <dd>The bounding box of an input (most commonly, touch) on a digitizer. This typically refers to devices with coarser pointer input resolution than a single pixel. Some devices do not report this data at all.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>digitizer</dfn></dt>
                <dd>A type of input sensing device in which a surface can detect input which is in contact and/or in close proximity. Most commonly, this is the surface that senses input from the touch contact or a pen/stylus.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>direct manipulation</dfn></dt>
                <dd>Certain user agents (such as browsers on a touchscreen device) implement a "direct manipulation" metaphor where a pointer not only interacts with controls, but
                is also used to directly pan or zoom the current page, providing the illusion of direct physical contact. As an example, users on a touchscreen device are generally
                able to use a finger or a stylus to "grab" a page and pan it by moving the pointer, directly manipulating the page. Contrast this with a mouse pointer on a regular
                desktop/laptop, where panning is done by using a scrollbar, rather than by "dragging" the page.
                <div class="note">In some cases, touchpads (like those found on a laptop) will allow the user to scroll by "dragging" on the touchpad. However, this is generally achieved
                by the touchpad generating "fake" mouse wheel events, so this wouldn't count as a direct manipulation.</div>
                </dd>
            <dt><dfn>hit test</dfn></dt>
                <dd>The process by which the user agent determines a target element for a pointer event. Typically, this is determined by considering the pointer's location and also the visual layout of elements in a document on screen media.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>measurable properties</dfn></dt>
                <dd><p>Measurable properties represent values relating to continuous pointer sensor data that is expressed using a real number or an
                    integer from a large domain. For pointer events, <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>pressure</code>,
                    <code>tangentialPressure</code>, <code>tiltX</code>, <code>tiltY</code>, <code>twist</code>,
                    <code>altitudeAngle</code>, <code>azimuthAngle</code>, and the [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Event model properties
                    <code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, <code>clientX</code>, <code>clientY</code> are measurable properties.</p>
                    <p>In contrast <code>pointerId</code>, <code>pointerType</code>, <code>isPrimary</code>, and the
                    [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Event model properties <code>button</code>, <code>buttons</code>, <code>ctrlKey</code>,
                    <code>shiftKey</code>, <code>altKey</code>, and <code>metaKey</code> are not considered measurable properties,
                    as they don't relate to sensor data.</p>
                    </dd>
            <dt><dfn>pointer</dfn></dt>
                <dd>A hardware agnostic representation of input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen, such as a mouse, pen, or touch contact.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>user agent</dfn></dt>
                <dd>A program, such as a browser or content authoring tool, normally running on a client machine, which acts on a user's behalf in retrieving, interpreting, executing, presenting, or creating content.</dd>
