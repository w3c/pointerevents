        <p>The features in this specification extend or modify those found in Pointer Events, a W3C Recommendation that describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. For compatibility with existing mouse based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire Mouse Events for other pointer device types.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
        <p>This specification is an update to [[PointerEvents]] which was shipped broadly only by Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge (though a further independent and mostly interoperable implementation was present in a pre-release build of Mozilla Firefox when the Pointer Events specification was published as a W3C Recommendation). Level 2 includes editorial clarifications, new features and minor breaking changes that address certain limitations and concerns that have been raised about aspects of the design, in an effort to enable wider browser adoption.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Today, most [[HTML5]] content is used with and/or designed for mouse input.  Those that handle input in a custom manner typically code to [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] Mouse Events. Newer computing devices today, however, incorporate other forms of input, including touchscreens, pen input, etc. Event types have been proposed for handling each of these forms of input individually. However, that approach often incurs unnecessary duplication of logic and event handling overhead when adding support for a new input type. This often creates a compatibility problem when content is written with only one device type in mind. Additionally, for compatibility with existing mouse-based content, most <a data-lt="user agent">user agents</a> fire Mouse Events for all input types. This makes it ambiguous whether a Mouse Event represents an actual mouse device or is being produced from another input type for compatibility, which makes it hard to code to both device types simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p>To reduce the cost of coding to multiple input types and also to help with the above described ambiguity with Mouse Events, this specifications defines a more abstract form of input, called a <a>pointer</a>. A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easier to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, this specification also defines properties for inspecting the device type which produced the event. The primary goal is to provide a single set of events and interfaces that allow for easier authoring for cross-device pointer input while still allowing for device-specific handling only when necessary for an augmented experience.</p>
        <p> An additional key goal is to enable multi-threaded user agents to handle default touch actions, such as scrolling, without blocking on script execution.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>While this specification defines a unified event model for a variety of pointer inputs, this model does not cover other forms of input such as keyboards or keyboard-like interfaces (for instance, a screenreader or similar assistive technology running on a touchscreen-only device, which allows users sequential navigation through focusable controls and elements). While user agents might choose to also generate pointer events in response to these interfaces, this scenario is not covered in this specification.</p>
          
            <p>In the first instance, authors are encouraged to provide equivalent functionality for all forms of input by responding to high-level events such as <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code> and <code>click</code>. However, when using low-level events (such as Pointer Events), authors are encouraged to ensure that all types of input are supported. In the case of keyboards and keyboard-like interfaces, this might require the addition of explicit keyboard event handling. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#keyboard-operation">WCAG 2.0 Guideline 2.1</a> for further details.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="pointer.png" alt="Pointer input combines input from mouse, pen, touch, etc.">
            <figcaption>A pointer is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen.</figcaption>
        </figure>
      
        <p>The events for handling generic pointer input look a lot like those for mouse: pointerdown, pointermove, pointerup, pointerover, pointerout, etc. This facilitates easy content migration from Mouse Events to Pointer Events.
        Pointer Events provide all the usual properties present in Mouse Events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. So authors can easily code to Pointer Events to share logic between different input types where it makes sense, and customize for a particular type of input only where necessary to get the best experience.</p>
        <p>While Pointer Events are sourced from a variety of input devices, they are not defined as being generated from some other set of device-specific events. While possible and encouraged for compatibility, this spec does not require other device-specific events be supported (e.g. mouse events, touch events, etc.).  A user agent could support pointer events without supporting any other device events. For compatibility with content written to mouse-specific events, this specification does provide an optional section describing how to generate <a>compatibility mouse events</a> based on pointer input from devices other than a mouse.</p>

        <div class="note informative">
            <p>This specification does not provide any advice on the expected behavior of user agents that support both Touch Events (as defined in [[TOUCH-EVENTS]]) and Pointer Events. For more information on the relationship between these two specifications, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/">Touch Events Community Group</a>.</p>

                    <p>Some pointer devices, such as mouse or pen, support multiple buttons. In the [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] Mouse Event model, each button press produces a <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event.  To better abstract this hardware difference and simplify cross-device input authoring, Pointer Events do not fire overlapping <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events for <a data-lt="Chorded Button Interactions">chorded button presses</a> (depressing an additional button while another button on the pointer device is already depressed).</p> 
                    <p>Instead, chorded button presses can be detected by inspecting changes to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties. The <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties are inherited from the [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] <code>MouseEvent</code> interface, but with a change in semantics and values, as outlined in the following sections.</p>

                <h2>The <dfn>Primary Pointer</dfn></h2>
                <p>In a multi-pointer (e.g. multi-touch) scenario, the <a href="#widl-PointerEvent-isPrimary"><code>isPrimary</code></a> property is used to identify a master pointer amongst the set of <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> for each pointer type.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At any given time, there can only ever be at most one primary pointer for each pointer type.</li>
                    <li>The first pointer to become active for a particular pointer type (e.g. the first finger to touch the screen in a multi-touch interaction) becomes the primary pointer for that pointer type.</li>
                    <li>Only a primary pointer will produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>. In the case where there are multiple <a data-lt="Primary Pointer">primary pointers</a>, these pointers will all produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note">Authors who desire single-pointer interaction can achieve this by ignoring non-primary pointers (however, see the note below on <a href="#multiple-primary-pointers">multiple primary pointers</a>).</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-primary-pointers">When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers (one for each <code>pointerType</code>) are considered primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will produce pointers that are both considered primary.</div>
                <div class="note">In some cases, it is possible for the user agent to fire pointer events in which no pointer is marked as a primary pointer. For instance, when there are multiple active pointers of a particular type like multi-touch and the primary pointer is removed (e.g. it leaves the screen), there will be no primary pointer events. Also on the platforms where the primary pointer is determined using all active pointers on the device (including those targeted at an application other than the user agent), if the first touch interaction is targeted outside the user agent and a secondary (multi-touch) touch interaction is targeted inside the user agent, then the user agent may fire pointer events for the second contact with a value of <code>false</code> for <code>isPrimary</code>.</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-mouse-inputs">Current operating systems and user agents don't usually have a concept of multiple mouse inputs. When more than one mouse device is present (for instance, on a laptop with both a trackpad and an external mouse), all mouse devices are generally treated as a single device - movements on any of the devices are translated to movement of a single mouse pointer, and there is no distinction between button presses on different mouse devices. For this reason, there will usually only be a single mouse pointer, and that pointer will be primary.</div>

                <p>If the event is not <code>gotpointercapture</code> or <code>lostpointercapture</code>, run <a href="#process-pending-pointer-capture">Process Pending Pointer Capture</a> steps for this <code>PointerEvent</code>.

                <p>The target object at which the event is fired is determined as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <a>pointer capture target override</a> has been set for the pointer, set the target to <a>pointer capture target override</a> object.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, set the target to the object returned by normal hit test mechanisms (out of scope for this specification).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If this is a <code>pointerdown</code> event, the associated device is a direct manipulation device and the target is an <code>Element</code>, then <a href="#setting-pointer-capture">set pointer capture</a> for this <code>pointerId</code> to the target element as described in <a>implicit pointer capture</a>.
                
                <p>Fire the event to the determined target.

                <div class="note">Using the <a>pointer capture target override</a> as the target instead of the normal hit-test result may fire some boundary events. This is the same as the pointer leaving its previous target and entering this new capturing target and if they are different targets boundary events should be dispatched first. When the capture is released the same scenario may happen as the pointer is leaving the capturing target and entering the hit-test target.</div>

            <h2>Pointer Event types</h2>
            <p>Below are the event types defined in this specification.</p>
            <p>In the case of the <a>primary pointer</a>, these events (with the exception of <code>gotpointercapture</code> and <code>lostpointercapture</code>) may also fire <a>compatibility mouse events</a>.</p>

                <h3>The <dfn><code>pointerover</code> event</dfn></h3>
                <p>A user agent MUST <a href="#firing-events-using-the-pointerevent-interface">fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointerover</code> when a pointing device is moved into the hit test boundaries of an element. Note that <code>setPointerCapture</code> or <code>releasePointerCapture</code> might have changed the hit test target and while a pointer is captured it is considered to be always inside the boundaries of the capturing element for the purpose of firing boundary events.

            <p>The <code>touch-action</code> CSS property determines whether touch input MAY  trigger default behavior supplied by user agent.  This includes, but is not limited to, behaviors such as panning or zooming. See the section on <a href="#details-of-touch-action-values"><code>touch-action</code> values</a>.</p>

            <div class="note">As noted previously, in the case of user agents that allow default behaviors (such as panning or zooming) for other pointer types, these user agents MUST apply the same consideration for those pointer types. For instance, if a user agent allows panning/zooming with a stylus, the user agent must take into account the relevant <code>touch-action</code> value when determining which default behaviors it should handle.</div>

            <p>During the execution of a user agent touch behavior, the user agent MUST NOT fire subsequent pointer events for the pointer. The user agent MUST <a href="#firing-events-using-the-pointerevent-interface">fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointercancel</code> (and subsequently a <code>pointerout</code> event and one or more <code>pointerleave</code> events) whenever all of the following are true, in order to end the stream of events for the pointer:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user agent has determined (via methods out of scope for this specification) that touch input is to be consumed for a touch behavior,</li>
                <li>a <code>pointerdown</code> event has been sent for the pointer, and</li>
                <li>a <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code> event (following the above mentioned <code>pointerdown</code>) has not yet been sent for the pointer.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Determining supported touch behavior</h2>
          <p>When a user touches an element, the effect of that touch is determined by the value of the <code>touch-action</code> property, and the default touch behaviors of the element and its ancestors, as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A touch behavior <dfn data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms to an element's <code>touch-action</code></dfn> if the behavior is allowed in the coordinate space of the element. Note that if CSS transforms have been applied, the element's coordinate space may differ from the screen coordinate in a way to affect the conformity here; for example, the X axis of an element rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the screen will be parallel to the Y-axis of the screen coodinate.</li>
            <li>A touch behavior is supported if it <a data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms</a> to the <code>touch-action</code> property of each element between the hit tested element and its nearest ancestor with the default touch behavior (including both the hit tested element and the element with the default touch behavior).</li>
            <li>Once a touch action has been started, and the user agent has already determined whether or not the action should be handled as a user agent touch behavior, any changes to the relevant <code>touch-action</code> value will be ignored for the duration of the touch action. For instance, programmatically changing the <code>touch-action</code> value for an element from <code>auto</code> to <code>none</code> as part of a <code>pointerdown</code> handler script will not result in the user agent aborting or suppressing any default touch behavior for that touch for as long as that pointer is active.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="note">Some user agents support touch actions triggered by interactions of multiple concurrent pointers (e.g. multi-touch). Methods for processing or associating the <code>touch-action</code> values of multiple concurrent pointers is out of scope for this specification.</div>

          <h2>Details of <code>touch-action</code> values</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>auto</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY determine any permitted touch behaviors, such as panning and zooming of the viewport, for touches that begin on the element.</dd>
            <dt>none</dt>
            <dd>Touches that begin on the element MUST NOT trigger default touch behaviors.</dd>
            <dt>pan-x<br>pan-left<br>pan-right<br>pan-y<br>pan-up<br>pan-down</dt>
            <dd>
              <p>The user agent MAY consider touches that begin on the element only for the purposes of scrolling that starts in any of the directions specified by all of the listed values.  Once scrolling is started, the direction may be reversed by the user even if scrolls that start in the reversed direction are disallowed. In contrast, when scrolling is restricted to starting along a single axis (eg. <code>pan-y</code>), the axis cannot be changed during the scroll.<p>
              <p>In the case of <code>pan-left</code>, <code>pan-right</code>, <code>pan-up</code> and <code>pan-down</code>, the direction is interpreted as the opposite of the physical movement in the local coordinate space. For example, <code>pan-up</code> corresponds to input event sequences where typically <code>screenY</code> is increasing (i.e. an interaction where the user moves a touch point down the screen) when the element has no effective CSS transforms. If the element is effectively rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise, <code>pan-up</code> would then correspond to input event sequences where <code>screenX</code> is increasing.</p></dd>
            <dt>manipulation</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY consider touches that begin on the element only for the purposes of scrolling and continuous zooming.  Any additional behaviors supported by <code>auto</code> are out of scope for this specification.</dd>
          </dl>
          <div class="note">Additional <code>touch-action</code> values common in implementations <a href="https://compat.spec.whatwg.org/#touch-action">are defined</a> in [[!COMPAT]].</div>
          <div class="note">The terms &quot;pan&quot; and &quot;scroll&quot; are considered synonymous. Defining an interaction or gesture for triggering panning or scrolling, or for triggering behavior for the <code>auto</code> or <code>none</code> values are out of scope for this specification.</div>
          <div class="note">The <code>touch-action</code> property only applies to elements that support both the CSS <code>width</code> and  <code>height</code> properties (see [[CSS21]]). This restriction is designed to facilitate user agent optimizations for <span>low-latency</span> touch actions. For elements not supported by default, such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> which is a <span>non-replaced inline element</span> (see [[HTML5]]), authors can set the <code>display</code> CSS property to a value, such as <code>block</code>, that supports <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Future specifications could extend this API to all elements.</div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>The direction-specific pan values are useful for customizing overscroll behavior.  For example, to implement a simple pull-to-refresh effect the document's touch-action can be set to <code>pan-x pan-down</code> whenever the scroll position is 0 and <code>pan-x pan-y</code> otherwise.  This allows pointer event handlers to define the behavior for upward scrolls that start from the top of the document.</p>
            <p>The direction-specific pan values can also be used for composing a component that implements custom panning with pointer event handling within an element that scrolls natively (or vice-versa).  For example, an image carousel may use <code>pan-y</code> to ensure it receives pointer events for any horizontal pan operations without interfering with vertical scrolling of the document.  When the carousel reaches its right-most extent, it may change its touch-action to <code>pan-y pan-right</code> so that a subsequent pan operation beyond its extent can scroll the document within the viewport if possible.  It's not possible to change the behavior of a pan in the middle of an operation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">Disabling some default touch behaviors may allow user agents to respond to other behaviors more quickly.  For example, with <code>auto</code> user agents typically add 300ms of delay before <code>click</code> to allow for double-tap gestures to be handled.  In these cases, explicitly setting <code>touch-action: none</code> or <code>touch-action: manipulation</code> will remove this delay. Note that the methods for determining a tap or double-tap gesture are out of scope for this specification.</div>

        <p>Pointer capture allows the events for a particular pointer (including any <a data-lt="compatibility mapping with mouse events">compatibility mouse events</a>) to be retargeted to a particular element other than the normal hit test result of the pointer's location. This is useful in scenarios like a custom slider control (e.g. similar to the [[HTML5]] <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> control). Pointer capture can be set on the slider thumb element, allowing the user to slide the control back and forth even if the pointer slides off of the thumb.</p>

            <h2><dfn>Implicit Pointer Capture</dfn></h2>
            <p>Some input devices (such as touchscreens) implement a "direct manipulation" metaphor where a pointer is intended to act primarily on the UI element it became active upon (providing a physical illusion of direct contact, instead of indirect contact via a cursor that conceptually floats above the UI). Such devices are identified by the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/InputDeviceCapabilities/#dom-inputdevicecapabilities-pointermovementscrolls">InputDeviceCapabilities.pointerMovementScrolls property</a> and should have "implicit pointer capture" behavior as follows.</p>
            <p>Direct manipulation devices should behave exactly as if <a data-lt="Element.setPointerCapture">setPointerCapture</a> was called on the target element just before the invocation of any <code>pointerdown</code> listeners.  The <a data-lt="Element.hasPointerCapture">hasPointerCapture</a> API may be used (eg. within any <code>pointerdown</code> listener) to determine whether this has occurred.  If <a data-lt="Element.releasePointerCapture">releasePointerCapture</a> is not called for the pointer before the next pointer event is fired, then a <a>gotpointercapture event</a> will be dispatched to the target (as normal) indicating that capture is active.</p>
            <div class="note">This is a breaking change from [[PointerEvents]], but does not impact the vast majority of existing content. In addition to matching typical platform UX conventions, this design for implicit capture enables user agents to make a performance optimization which prevents the need to invoke hit-testing on touch movement events without explicit developer opt-in (consistent with the performance properties of existing dominant native and web APIs for touch input).</div>
            <div class="note">In addition, user agents may implement implicit pointer capture behavior for all input devices on specific UI widgets such as input range controls (allowing some finger movement to stray outside of the form control itself during the interaction).</div>

            <h3>Implicit Release of Pointer Capture</h3>

            <p>If the user agent supports firing the <code>click</code> event (see <a title="compatibility mouse events" href="#dfn-compatibility-mouse-events">compatibility mouse events</a>) and if in an implicit release scenario both <code>click</code> and <code>lostpointercapture</code> events are fired, <code>click</code> should be fired before <code>lostpointercapture</code>.</p>
            <p>When the <a>pointer capture target override</a> is removed from its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree,
clear the <a>pending pointer capture target override</a> and <a>pointer capture target override</a> nodes
and fire a PointerEvent named <code>lostpointercapture</code> corresponding to the captured pointer at the document.</p>
            <p>When a pointer lock ([[!PointerLock]]) is successfully applied on an element, a user agent MUST run the steps as if the releasePointerCapture() method has been called if any element is set to be captured or pending to be captured.

        <h1><dfn data-lt="compatibility mouse events">Compatibility Mapping with Mouse Events</dfn></h1>
        <p>The vast majority of web content existing today codes only to Mouse Events. The following describes an algorithm for how a user agent MAY map generic pointer input to mouse events for compatibility with this content.</p>
        <p>The compatibility mapping with mouse events are an OPTIONAL feature of this specification. User agents are encouraged to support the feature for best compatibility with existing legacy content. User agents that do not support compatibility mouse events are still encouraged to support the <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> events (see the note below).</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>The <code>click</code> event, defined in [[DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]], and the <code>contextmenu</code> event, defined in [[HTML5]], are not considered <a title="compatibility mouse events" href="#dfn-compatibility-mouse-events">compatibility mouse events</a> as they are typically tied to user interface activation and are fired from other input devices, like keyboards.</p>
            <p>In user agents that support firing <code>click</code> and/or <code>contextmenu</code>, calling <code>preventDefault</code> during a pointer event typically does not have an effect on whether <code>click</code> and/or <code>contextmenu</code> are fired or not.  Because they are not compatibility mouse events, user agents typically fire <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> for all pointing devices, including pointers that are not primary pointers.</p>
            <p>The relative ordering of these high-level events (<code>click</code>, <code>contextmenu</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, etc.) with pointer events is undefined and varies between user agents. For example, in some user agents <code>contextmenu</code> will often follow a <code>pointerup</code>, in others it'll often precede a <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code>, and in some situations it may be fired without any corresponding pointer event (such as a keyboard shortcut).</p>
        </div>
        <p>Unless otherwise noted, the target of any mapped mouse event SHOULD be the same target as the respective pointer event unless the target is no longer participating in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree. In this case, the mouse event should be fired at the original target's nearest ancestor node (at the time it was removed from the tree) that still participates in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree, meaning that a new event path (based on the new target node) is built for the mouse event.</p>
        <p>Authors can prevent the production of certain compatibility mouse events by canceling the <code>pointerdown</code> event. </p>
        <div class="note">Mouse events can only be prevented when the pointer is down.  Hovering pointers (e.g. a mouse with no buttons pressed) cannot have their mouse events prevented. And, the <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code>, and <code>mouseleave</code> events are never prevented (even if the pointer is down).</div>
        <section>
            <h2><dfn>Tracking the effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</dfn></h2>
            <p>While only the <a data-lt="Primary Pointer">primary pointers</a> can produce compatibility mouse events, <a href="#multiple-primary-pointers">multiple primary pointers</a> can be active simultaneously, each producing its own compatibility mouse events.  Since all these compatibility events would appear to MouseEvent code to be coming from a single mouse device, user agents are encouraged to guarantee that the compatibility mouse events are consistent from a single device perspective.  For mouse transition events (i.e., <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>), this means the entry/exit state for every event target is valid as implied by [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]].  Users agents SHOULD guarantee this by maintaining the <dfn>effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</dfn> in the document as follows.</p>
            <p>Right before firing a <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointermove</code> event, or a <code>pointerleave</code> event at the <code>window</code>, the user agent SHOULD run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Let <code>T</code> be the target of the <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointermove</code> event being dispatched. For the <code>pointerleave</code> event, unset <code>T</code>.</li>
                <li>If <code>T</code> and current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> are both unset or they are uqual, terminate these steps.</li>
                <li>Dispatch <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events as per [[!DOM-LEVEL-3-EVENTS]] for a mouse moving from the current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> to <code>T</code>. Consider an unset value of either current <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> or <code>T</code> as an out-of-window mouse position.</li>
                <li>Set <a data-lt="effective position of the legacy mouse pointer">effective legacy mouse pointer position</a> to <code>T</code>.</li>

            <h2>Mapping for devices that support hover</h2>
            <p>Whenever a user agent is to dispatch a pointer event for a device that supports hover, it SHOULD run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the <code>isPrimary</code> property for the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>false</code> then dispatch the pointer event and terminate these steps.</li>

            <h2>Mapping for devices that do not support hover</h2>
            <p>Some devices, such as most touchscreens, do not support hovering a coordinate (or set of coordinates) while not in the active state. Much existing content coded to mouse events assumes that a mouse is producing the events and thus certain qualities are generally true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The input can hover independently of activation (e.g. moving a mouse cursor without any buttons pressed).</li>
                <li>The input will likely produce the <code>mousemove</code> event on an element before clicking it.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="note">Hover is sometimes used to toggle the visibility of UI elements in content designed for mouse (e.g. "hover menus"). This content is often incompatible with <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>devices that do not support hover</a>. This specification does not define a mapping or behavior for compatibility with this scenario. It will be considered in a future version of the specification.</div>
            <p>This requires that user agents provide a different mapping for these types of input devices. Whenever a user agent is to dispatch a pointer event for a device that <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>does not support hover</a>, it SHOULD run the following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>If the <code>isPrimary</code> property for the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>false</code> then dispatch the pointer event and terminate these steps.</li>
                <li>If the pointer event to be dispatched is <code>pointerover</code> and the <code>pointerdown</code> event has not yet been dispatched for this pointer, then fire a <code>mousemove</code> event (for compatibility with legacy mouse-specific code).</li>
                <li>If the pointer event to be is dispatched is a <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointermove</code> event, or a <code>pointerleave</code> event at the <code>window</code>, dispatch compatibility mouse transition events as described in <a>Tracking the effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</a>.</li>
                <li>Dispatch the pointer event.</li>
                <li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerdown</code> and the event was <a data-lt="canceled event">canceled</a>, then set the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>
                <li>If the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag is <b>not</b> set for this <code>pointerType</code> and the pointer event dispatched was:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>pointerdown</code>, then fire a <code>mousedown</code> event.</li>
                        <li><code>pointermove</code>, then fire a <code>mousemove</code> event.</li>
                        <li><code>pointerup</code>, then fire a <code>mouseup</code> event.</li>
                        <li><code>pointercancel</code>, then fire a <code>mouseup</code> event at the <code>window</code>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If the pointer event dispatched was <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code>, clear the <i>PREVENT MOUSE EVENT</i> flag for this <code>pointerType</code>.</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="note">
                <p>If the user agent supports both Touch Events (as defined in [[TOUCH-EVENTS]]) and Pointer Events, the user agent SHOULD NOT generate compatibility mouse events as described in this section as it is likely to introduce compatibility problems for sites that expect mouse events to be generated in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#mouse-events">model</a> outlined in [[TOUCH-EVENTS]].</p>
            </div>
            <div class="note">
                <p>The activation of an element (<code>click</code>) with a primary pointer that <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>does not support hover</a> (e.g. single finger on a touchscreen) would typically produce the following event sequence:</p>
                <ol data-class="note-list">

        <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
        <p>This appendix discusses security and privacy considerations for Pointer Events implementations. The discussion is limited to security and privacy issues that arise directly from implementation of the event model, APIs and events defined in this specification.</p>
        <p>Many of the event types defined in this specification are dispatched in response to user actions. This allows malicious event listeners to gain access to information users would typically consider confidential, e.g., the exact path/movement of a user's mouse/stylus/finger while interacting with a page.</p>
        <p>Pointer events contain additional information (where supported by the user's device), such as the angle or tilt at which a pen input is held, the geometry of the contact surface, and the pressure exerted on the stylus or touch screen. Information about angle, tilt, geometry and pressure are directly related to sensors on the user's device, meaning that this specification allows an origin access to these sensors.</p>
        <p>This sensor data, as well as the ability to determine the type of input mechanism (mouse, touch, pen) used, may be used to infer characteristics of a user, or of the user's device and environment. This information can also be potentially used for the purposes of building a user profile and/or attempting to "fingerprint" and track a particular user.</p>
        <p>Beyond these considerations, the working group believes that this specification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not expose personally-identifiable information.</li>
            <li>Does not deal with high-value data.</li>
            <li>Does not introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions.</li>
            <li>Does not expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not expose any other data to an origin that it doesn’t currently have access to.</li>
            <li>Does not enable new script execution/loading mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to a user’s location.</li>
            <li>Does not require any special handling when the user agent is in "incognito" mode.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to other devices.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin control over a user agent’s native UI.</li>
            <li>Does not expose temporary identifiers to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts.</li>
            <li>Does not persist data to a user’s local device.</li>
            <li>Does not allow downgrading default security characteristics.</li>
        </ul>
