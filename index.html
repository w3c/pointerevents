        <p>The features in this specification extend or modify those found in Pointer Events, a W3C Recommendation that describes events and related interfaces for handling hardware agnostic pointer input from devices including a mouse, pen, touchscreen, etc. For compatibility with existing mouse based content, this specification also describes a mapping to fire Mouse Events for other pointer device types.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sotd">
        <p>This specification is an update to [[PointerEvents2]] which was shipped broadly by Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.
           Level 3 includes editorial clarifications and new features that facilitate more use cases, in an effort to enable wider developer and browser adoption.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Today, most [[HTML]] content is used with and/or designed for mouse input. Those that handle input in a custom manner typically code to [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Events. Newer computing devices today, however, incorporate other forms of input, including touchscreens, pen input, etc. Event types have been proposed for handling each of these forms of input individually. However, that approach often incurs unnecessary duplication of logic and event handling overhead when adding support for a new input type. This often creates a compatibility problem when content is written with only one device type in mind. Additionally, for compatibility with existing mouse-based content, most <a data-lt="user agent">user agents</a> fire Mouse Events for all input types. This makes it ambiguous whether a Mouse Event represents an actual mouse device or is being produced from another input type for compatibility, which makes it hard to code to both device types simultaneously.</p>

        <p>To reduce the cost of coding to multiple input types and also to help with the above described ambiguity with Mouse Events, this specifications defines a more abstract form of input, called a <a>pointer</a>. A pointer can be any point of contact on the screen made by a mouse cursor, pen, touch (including multi-touch), or other pointing input device. This model makes it easier to write sites and applications that work well no matter what hardware the user has. For scenarios when device-specific handling is desired, this specification also defines properties for inspecting the device type which produced the event. The primary goal is to provide a single set of events and interfaces that allow for easier authoring for cross-device pointer input while still allowing for device-specific handling only when necessary for an augmented experience.</p>
        <p>An additional key goal is to enable multi-threaded user agents to handle <a>direct manipulation</a> actions for panning and zooming (for instance, with a finger or stylus on a touchscreen), without blocking on script execution.</p>

        <div class="note">
            <p>While this specification defines a unified event model for a variety of pointer inputs, this model does not cover other forms of input such as keyboards or keyboard-like interfaces (for instance, a screen reader or similar assistive technology running on a touchscreen-only device, which allows users sequential navigation through focusable controls and elements). While user agents might choose to also generate pointer events in response to these interfaces, this scenario is not covered in this specification.</p>

            <p>In the first instance, authors are encouraged to provide equivalent functionality for all forms of input by responding to high-level events such as <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code> and <code>click</code>. However, when using low-level events (such as Pointer Events), authors are encouraged to ensure that all types of input are supported. In the case of keyboards and keyboard-like interfaces, this might require the addition of explicit keyboard event handling. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#keyboard-accessible"><cite><abbr title="Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible</cite></a> [[WCAG21]] for further details.</p>
        </div>

            <img src="images/pointer.png" alt="Pointer input combines input from mouse, pen, touch, etc.">
            <figcaption>A pointer is a hardware agnostic representation of input devices that can target a specific coordinate (or set of coordinates) on a screen.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The events for handling generic pointer input look a lot like those for mouse: <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointermove</code>, <code>pointerup</code>, <code>pointerover</code>, <code>pointerout</code>, etc. This facilitates easy content migration from Mouse Events to Pointer Events.
        Pointer Events provide all the usual properties present in Mouse Events (client coordinates, target element, button states, etc.) in addition to new properties for other forms of input: pressure, contact geometry, tilt, etc. So authors can easily code to Pointer Events to share logic between different input types where it makes sense, and customize for a particular type of input only where necessary to get the best experience.</p>
        <p>While Pointer Events are sourced from a variety of input devices, they are not defined as being generated from some other set of device-specific events. While possible and encouraged for compatibility, this spec does not require other device-specific events be supported (e.g. mouse events, touch events, etc.). A user agent could support pointer events without supporting any other device events. For compatibility with content written to mouse-specific events, this specification does provide an optional section describing how to generate <a>compatibility mouse events</a> based on pointer input from devices other than a mouse.</p>

        <div class="note informative">
            <p>This specification does not provide any advice on the expected behavior of user agents that support both Touch Events (as defined in [[TOUCH-EVENTS]]) and Pointer Events. For more information on the relationship between these two specifications, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/touchevents/">Touch Events Community Group</a>.</p>

                            <p>A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event. User agents MAY reserve a generic <code>pointerId</code> value of <code>0</code> or <code>1</code> for the primary mouse pointer. The <code>pointerId</code> value of <code>-1</code> MUST be reserved and used to indicate events that were generated by something other than a pointing device. For any other pointers, user agents are free to implement different strategies and approaches in how they assign a <code>pointerId</code> value. However, all <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> in the <a>top-level browsing context</a> (as defined by [[HTML]]) must be unique, and the identifier MUST NOT be influenced by any other top-level browsing context (i.e. one top-level browsing context cannot assume that the <code>pointerId</code> of a pointer will be the same when the pointer moves outside of the browsing context and into another top-level browsing context). The user agent MAY recycle previously retired values for <code>pointerId</code> from previous active pointers, or it MAY always reuse the same <code>pointerId</code> for a particular pointing device (for instance, to uniquely identify particular pen/stylus inputs from a specific user in a multi-user collaborative application). However, in the latter case, to minimize the chance of fingerprinting and tracking across different pages or domains, the <code>pointerId</code> MUST only be associated explicitly with that particular pointing device for the lifetime of the page / session, and a new randomized <code>pointerId</code> MUST be chosen the next time that particular pointing device is used again in a new session.</p>

                                <p>The <code>pointerId</code> selection algorithm is implementation specific. Therefore authors cannot assume values convey any particular meaning other than an identifier for the pointer that is unique from all other active pointers. As an example, user agents may simply assign a number, starting from <code>0</code>, to any active pointers, in the order that they become active — but these values are not guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.</p>

                    <p>Some pointer devices, such as mouse or pen, support multiple buttons. In the [[UIEVENTS]] Mouse Event model, each button press produces a <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code> event. To better abstract this hardware difference and simplify cross-device input authoring, Pointer Events do not fire overlapping <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events for chorded button presses (depressing an additional button while another button on the pointer device is already depressed).</p>
                    <p>Instead, chorded button presses can be detected by inspecting changes to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties. The <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties are inherited from the {{MouseEvent}} interface, but with a change in semantics and values, as outlined in the following sections.</p>
                    <p>The modifications to the <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> properties apply only to pointer events. For any <a>compatibility mouse events</a> the value of <code>button</code> and <code>buttons</code> MUST follow [[UIEVENTS]].</p>

                <h2>The <dfn>primary pointer</dfn></h2>
                <p>In a multi-pointer (e.g. multi-touch) scenario, the <code>isPrimary</code> property is used to identify a master pointer amongst the set of <a data-lt="active pointer">active pointers</a> for each pointer type.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>At any given time, there can only ever be at most one primary pointer for each pointer type.</li>
                    <li>The first pointer to become active for a particular pointer type (e.g. the first finger to touch the screen in a multi-touch interaction) becomes the primary pointer for that pointer type.</li>
                    <li>Only a primary pointer will produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>. In the case where there are multiple <a>primary pointers</a>, these pointers will all produce <a>compatibility mouse events</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="note">Authors who desire single-pointer interaction can achieve this by ignoring non-primary pointers (however, see the note below on <a href="#multiple-primary-pointers">multiple primary pointers</a>).</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-primary-pointers">When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers (one for each <code>pointerType</code>) are considered primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will produce pointers that are both considered primary.</div>
                <div class="note">Some devices, operating systems and user agents may ignore the concurrent use of more than one type of pointer input to avoid accidental interactions. For instance, devices that support both touch and pen interactions may ignore touch inputs while the pen is actively being used, to allow users to rest their hand on the touchscreen while using the pen (a feature commonly referred to as "palm rejection"). Currently, it is not possible for authors to suppress this behavior.</div>
                <div class="note">In some cases, it is possible for the user agent to fire pointer events in which no pointer is marked as a primary pointer. For instance, when there are multiple active pointers of a particular type, like a multi-touch interaction, and the primary pointer is removed (e.g. it leaves the screen), there may end up being no primary pointers. Also on platforms where the primary pointer is determined using all active pointers of the same type on the device (including those targeted at an application other than the user agent), if the first (primary) pointer is outside of the user agent and other (non-primary) pointers targeted inside the user agent, then the user agent may fire pointer events for the other pointers with a value of <code>false</code> for <code>isPrimary</code>.</div>
                <div class="note" id="multiple-mouse-inputs">Current operating systems and user agents don't usually have a concept of multiple mouse inputs. When more than one mouse device is present (for instance, on a laptop with both a trackpad and an external mouse), all mouse devices are generally treated as a single device — movements on any of the devices are translated to movement of a single mouse pointer, and there is no distinction between button presses on different mouse devices. For this reason, there will usually only be a single mouse pointer, and that pointer will be primary.</div>

                <p>To <dfn>fire a pointer event</dfn> named |e| means to [=fire an event=] named |e| using <a>PointerEvent</a> whose attributes are set as defined in {{PointerEvent}} Interface and <a href="#attributes-and-default-actions">Attributes and Default Actions</a>.</p>
                <p>If the event is not <code>gotpointercapture</code> or <code>lostpointercapture</code>, run <a href="#process-pending-pointer-capture">Process Pending Pointer Capture</a> steps for this <code>PointerEvent</code>.

                <p>The target object at which the event is fired is determined as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the <a>pointer capture target override</a> has been set for the pointer, set the target to <a>pointer capture target override</a> object.</li>
                    <li>Otherwise, set the target to the object returned by normal hit test mechanisms (out of scope for this specification).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Let |targetDocument| be target's [=Node/node document=] [[DOM]].

                <p>If the event is <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointermove</code>, or <code>pointerup</code> set <a>active document</a> for the event's <code>pointerId</code> to |targetDocument|.</p>

                <p>If the event is <code>pointerdown</code>, the associated device is a direct manipulation device, and the target is an {{Element}},
                   then <a href="#setting-pointer-capture">set pointer capture</a> for this <code>pointerId</code> to the target element as described in <a>implicit pointer capture</a>.

                <p>Fire the event to the determined target. The user agent SHOULD treat the target as if the pointing device has moved over it for the purpose of <a href="uievents/#events-mouseevent-event-order">ensuring event ordering</a>.

                <div class="note">Using the <a>pointer capture target override</a> as the target instead of the normal hit-test result may fire some boundary events, as defined by [[UIEVENTS]]. This is the same as the pointer leaving its previous target and entering this new capturing target.

                        <p>Viewport manipulations (panning and zooming) — generally, as a result of a <a>direct manipulation</a> interaction — are intentionally NOT a default action of pointer events, meaning that these behaviors (e.g. panning a page as a result of moving a finger on a touchscreen) cannot be suppressed by cancelling a pointer event. Authors must instead use <code>touch-action</code> to explicitly <a href="#declaring-candidate-regions-for-direct-manipulation-behaviors">declare the direct manipulation behavior</a> for a region of the document.

                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointerover</code> when a pointing device is moved into the hit test boundaries of an element. Note that <code>setPointerCapture()</code> or <code>releasePointerCapture()</code> might have changed the hit test target and while a pointer is captured it is considered to be always inside the boundaries of the capturing element for the purpose of firing boundary events.

                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointerenter</code> when a pointing device is moved into the hit test boundaries of an element or one of its descendants, including as a result of a <code>pointerdown</code> event from a device that <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>does not support hover</a> (see <code><a>pointerdown</a></code>). Note that <code>setPointerCapture()</code> or <code>releasePointerCapture()</code> might have changed the hit test target and while a pointer is captured it is considered to be always inside the boundaries of the capturing element for the purpose of firing boundary events.

                <div class="note">There are similarities between this event type, the <code>mouseenter</code> event described in [[UIEVENTS]], and the CSS <code>:hover</code> pseudo-class described in [[CSS21]]. See also the <a><code>pointerleave</code> event</a>.</div>

                <h3>The <dfn data-lt="pointerdown"><code>pointerdown</code> event</dfn></h3>
                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointerdown</code> when a pointer enters the <a>active buttons state</a>. For mouse, this is when the device transitions from no buttons depressed to at least one button depressed. For touch, this is when physical contact is made with the <a>digitizer</a>. For pen, this is when the pen either makes physical contact with the digitizer without any button depressed, or transitions from no buttons depressed to at least one button depressed while hovering.</p>
                <div class="note">For mouse (or other multi-button pointer devices), this means <code>pointerdown</code> and <code>pointerup</code> are not fired for all of the same circumstances as <code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code>. See <a>chorded buttons</a> for more information.</div>
                <p>For input <a href=#mapping-for-devices-that-do-not-support-hover>devices that do not support hover</a>, the user agent MUST also <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointerover</code> followed by a pointer event named <code>pointerenter</code> prior to dispatching the <code>pointerdown</code> event.</p>
                <div class="note">Authors can prevent the firing of certain <a>compatibility mouse events</a> by canceling the <code>pointerdown</code> event (if the <code>isPrimary</code> property is <code>true</code>).

                <h3>The <dfn data-lt="pointermove"><code>pointermove</code> event</dfn></h3>
                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointermove</code> when a pointer changes button state.
                Additionally one <code>pointermove</code> MUST be fired when pointer changes coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or
                contact geometry (e.g. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>) and the circumstances produce no other pointer events defined in this specification. User agents MAY delay dispatch of the <code>pointermove</code> event (for instance, for performance reasons).
                The <a>coalesced events</a> information will be exposed via the <code><a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents">getCoalescedEvents()</a></code> method for the single dispatched <code>pointermove</code> event.
                The final coordinates of such events should be used for finding the target of the event.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>The <dfn data-lt="pointerrawupdate"><code>pointerrawupdate</code> event</dfn></h3>
                <p>The user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a>
                named <code>pointerrawupdate</code> only within a [=secure context=] when
                a pointer's attributes (i.e. button state, coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or contact geometry) change.</p>
                <p>In contrast with <code>pointermove</code>, user agents SHOULD dispatch <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events as soon as possible
                and as frequently as the JavaScript can handle the events.</p>
                <p>The <code>target</code> of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events might be different from the <code>pointermove</code> events
                due to the fact that <code>pointermove</code> events might get delayed or coalesced, and the final position of the event
                which is used for finding the <code>target</code> could be different from its coalesced events.</p>
                <p>Note that if there is already another <code>pointerrawupdate</code> with the same <code>pointerId</code> that hasn't been dispatched
                in the [=event loop=], the
                user agent MAY coalesce the new <code>pointerrawupdate</code> with that event instead of creating a new [=task=].
                This may cause <code>pointerrawupdate</code> to have coalesced events, and
                they will all be delivered as <a>coalesced events</a> of one <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event as soon as
                the event is processed in the [=event loop=].
                See <code><a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents">getCoalescedEvents()</a></code> for more information.</p>
                <p>In terms of ordering of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> and <code>pointermove</code>,
                if the user agent received an update from the platform that causes both <code>pointerrawupdate</code> and <code>pointermove</code> events,
                then the user agent MUST dispatch the <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event before the corresponding <code>pointermove</code>.</p>
                <p>Other than the <code>target</code>, the concatenation of coalesced events lists of all dispatched <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events
                since the last <code>pointermove</code> event is the same as the coalesced events of the next <code>pointermove</code> event in terms of the other event attributes.
                The attributes of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> are mostly the same as <code>pointermove</code>, with the exception of
                <code>cancelable</code> which MUST be false for <code>pointerrawupdate</code>.</p>
                <p>User agents SHOULD not fire <a>compatibility mouse events</a> for <code>pointerrawupdate</code>.</p>
                <div class="note">Adding listeners for the <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event might negatively impact the performance of the web page, depending on the implementation of the user agent.
                For most use cases the other pointerevent types should suffice.
                A <code>pointerrawupdate</code> listener should only be added if JavaScript needs high frequency events and can handle them just as fast.
                In these cases, there is probably no need to listen to other types of pointer events.</div>

For mouse, this is when the device transitions from at least one button depressed to no buttons depressed. For touch, this is when physical contact is removed from the <a>digitizer</a>.

                     and therefore the start of a pan or zoom action may result in the cancellation of various pointers, including pointers with different pointer types.

                <p>This section is an addition to <a data-cite="uievents/#event-type-click">click</a> and
                   <a data-cite="uievents/#event-type-auxclick">auxclick</a> events defined in [[UIEVENTS]] and
                   [=HTMLElement/contextmenu=] defined in [[HTML]]. The type of these events MUST be <code>PointerEvent</code>,
                   but the dispatch process is going to match that of the original specification.</p>
                   For these events, all <code>PointerEvent</code> specific attributes (defined in this spec) other than <code>pointerId</code> and <code>pointerType</code> will have their default values. In addition:</p>
                   <ul>
                       <li>If the events are generated by a pointing device, their <code>pointerId</code> and <code>pointerType</code> MUST be the same as the PointerEvents that caused these events.</li>
                       <li>If the events are generated by a non-pointing device (such as voice recognition software or a keyboard interaction), <code>pointerId</code> MUST be <code>-1</code> and <code>pointerType</code> MUST be an empty string.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>As noted in {{PointerEvent}}, [[[CSSOM-VIEW]]] proposes to redefine the various coordinate properties (<code>screenX</code>, <code>screenY</code>, <code>pageX</code>, <code>pageY</code>, <code>clientX</code>,
                   <code>clientY</code>, <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>offsetX</code>, <code>offsetY</code>) as <code>double</code>, to allow for fractional coordinates.
                   However, this change — when applied only to {{PointerEvent}}, but not to regular {{MouseEvent}} — has proven to lead to web compatibility issues with legacy code
                   in the case of <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, and <code>contextmenu</code>. For this reason, user agents that have implemented the proposed
                   change in [[[CSSOM-VIEW]]] only for {{PointerEvent}} MUST convert the various coordinate properties for the <code>click</code>, <code>auxclick</code>, and <code>contextmenu</code>
                   to <code>long</code> values (as defined in the original [[[UIEVENTS]]]) using <a data-cite="ECMASCRIPT#sec-math.floor">Math.floor</a> [[ECMASCRIPT]].</p>

        <h1>Declaring candidate regions for direct manipulation behaviors</h1>
        <p>As noted in <a href="#attributes-and-default-actions">Attributes and Default Actions</a>, viewport manipulations (panning and zooming) cannot be suppressed by cancelling a pointer event. Instead, authors must explicitly define which of these behaviors they want to allow, and which they want to suppress, using the <code>touch-action</code> CSS property.</p>
        <div class="note">While the issue of pointers used to manipulate the viewport is generally limited to touch input (where a user's finger can both interact with content and panning/zoom the page), certain user agents may also allow the same types of (direct or indirect) manipulation for other pointer types. For instance, on mobile/tablet devices, users may also be able to scroll using a stylus. While, for historical reasons, the <code>touch-action</code> CSS property defined in this specification appears to refer only to touch inputs, it does in fact apply to all forms of pointer inputs that allow <a>direct manipulation</a> for panning and zooming.</div>
        <section>
            <h2>The <dfn><code>touch-action</code></dfn> CSS property</h2>
            <table class="simple">
                <tr><th>Name:</th><td><code>touch-action</code></td></tr>
                <tr><th>Value:</th><td><code>auto</code> | <code>none</code> | [ [ <code>pan-x</code> | <code>pan-left</code> | <code>pan-right</code> ] || [ <code>pan-y</code> | <code>pan-up</code> | <code>pan-down</code> ] ] | <code>manipulation</code></td></tr>

                <tr><th>Computed value:</th><td>Same as specified value.</td></tr>
            </table>

            <p>The <code>touch-action</code> CSS property determines whether <a>direct manipulation</a> interactions (which are not limited to touch, despite the property's name) MAY trigger the user agent's panning and zooming behavior. See the section on <a href="#details-of-touch-action-values"><code>touch-action</code> values</a>.</p>

            <p>While panning and zooming, the user agent MUST NOT fire subsequent pointer events for the pointer. In order to end the stream of events for the pointer, the user agent MUST <a>fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointercancel</code> (and subsequently a <code>pointerout</code> event and one or more <code>pointerleave</code> events) whenever all of the following are true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user agent has determined (via methods out of scope for this specification) that a direct manipulation interaction is to be consumed for panning or zooming,</li>
                <li>a <code>pointerdown</code> event has been sent for the pointer, and</li>
                <li>a <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code> event (following the above mentioned <code>pointerdown</code>) has not yet been sent for the pointer.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">Some user agents implement complex gestures for behaviors that involve a series of separate discrete gestures, but which are all treated as part of a single continuous gesture. For example, consider a "fling to scroll" gesture on a touchscreen: a user starts panning the document with a rapid finger movement, lifts the finger from the touchscreen, and the document continues panning with simulated inertia. While the document is still moving, the user may place their finger on the touchscreen and execute another "fling" to provide further momentum for the panning, or counteract the current panning to slow it down, stop panning altogether, or reverse the direction of the panning. As this specification does not normatively define how gestures and behaviors are implemented, it is left up to the user agent to decide whether or not the second touch (before it is interpreted as a second "fling" or counteraction of the current panning) fires pointer events or not.</div>

            <div class="note"><code>touch-action</code> does not apply/cascade through to embedded browsing contexts. For instance, even applying <code>touch-action</code> to an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> won't have any effect on the behavior of direct manipulation interactions for panning and zooming within the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> itself.</div>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Determining supported direct manipulation behavior</h2>
          <p>When a user interacts with an element using a <a>direct manipulation</a> pointer (such as touch or stylus on a touchscreen), the effect of that input is determined by the value of the <code>touch-action</code> property, and the default direct manipulation behaviors of the element and its ancestors, as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A direct manipulation interaction for panning and zooming <dfn data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms to an element's <code>touch-action</code></dfn> if the behavior is allowed in the coordinate space of the element. Note that if CSS transforms have been applied, the element's coordinate space may differ from the screen coordinate in a way to affect the conformity here; for example, the X axis of an element rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the screen will be parallel to the Y-axis of the screen coordinate.</li>
            <li>A direct manipulation interaction for panning and zooming is supported if it <a data-lt="conforming-touch-behavior">conforms</a> to the <code>touch-action</code> property of each element between the hit tested element and its nearest ancestor with the default direct manipulation behavior (including both the hit tested element and the element with the default direct manipulation behavior).</li>
            <li>Once panning or zooming has been started, and the user agent has already determined whether or not the gesture should be handled as a user agent direct manipulation behavior, any changes to the relevant <code>touch-action</code> value will be ignored for the duration of the action. For instance, programmatically changing the <code>touch-action</code> value for an element from <code>auto</code> to <code>none</code> as part of a <code>pointerdown</code> handler script will not result in the user agent aborting or suppressing any of the pan or zoom behavior for that input for as long as that pointer is active.</li>
            <li>Similarly, in the case of the various <code>touch-action</code> values of <code>pan-*</code>, once the user agent has determined whether to handle a gesture directly or not at the start of the gesture, a subsequent change in the direction of the same gesture SHOULD be ignored by the user agent for as long as that pointer is active. For instance, if an element has been set to <code>touch-action: pan-y</code> (meaning that only vertical panning is handled by the user agent), and a touch gesture starts off horizontally, no vertical panning should occur if the user changes the direction of their gesture to be vertical while their finger is still touching the screen.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="note">Some user agents support panning and zooming interactions involving multiple concurrent pointers (e.g. multi-touch). Methods for processing or associating the <code>touch-action</code> values of multiple concurrent pointers is out of scope for this specification.</div>

        <section>
          <h2>Details of <code>touch-action</code> values</h2>
          <p>The <code>touch-action</code> property covers direct manipulation behaviors related to viewport panning and zooming. Any additional user agent behaviors, such as text selection/highlighting, or activating links and form controls, MUST NOT be affected by this CSS property.</p>
          <div class="note">The terms "panning" and "scrolling" are considered synonymous (or, more aptly, "panning" is "scrolling" using a direct manipulation input). Defining an interaction or gesture for triggering panning/scrolling, or for triggering behavior for the <code>auto</code> or <code>none</code> values, are out of scope for this specification.</div>
          <dl>
            <dt>auto</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY consider any permitted direct manipulation behaviors related to panning and zooming of the viewport that begin on the element.</dd>
            <dt>none</dt>
            <dd>Direct manipulation interactions that begin on the element MUST NOT trigger behaviors related to viewport panning and zooming.</dd>
            <dt>pan-x<br>pan-left<br>pan-right<br>pan-y<br>pan-up<br>pan-down</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY consider direct manipulation interactions that begin on the element only for the purposes of panning that starts in any of the directions specified by all of the listed values. Once panning has started, the direction may be reversed by the user even if panning that starts in the reversed direction are disallowed. In contrast, when panning is restricted to a single axis (eg. <code>pan-y</code>), the axis cannot be changed during panning.<p>
            <dt>manipulation</dt>
            <dd>The user agent MAY consider direct manipulation interactions that begin on the element only for the purposes of panning and <strong>continuous</strong> zooming (such as pinch-zoom), but MUST NOT trigger other related behaviors that rely on multiple activations that must happen within a set period of time (such as double-tap to zoom, or double-tap and hold for single-finger zoom).</dd>
          </dl>
          <div class="note"><a data-cite="compat/#touch-action">Additional <code>touch-action</code> values</a> common in implementations are defined in [[COMPAT]].</div>
          <div class="note">The <code>touch-action</code> property only applies to elements that support both the CSS <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> properties (see [[CSS21]]). This restriction is designed to facilitate user agent optimizations for <em>low-latency</em> <a>direct manipulation</a> panning and zooming. For elements not supported by default, such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> which is a <em>non-replaced inline element</em>, authors can set the <code>display</code> CSS property to a value, such as <code>block</code>, that supports <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>. Future specifications could extend this API to all elements.</div>
          <div class="note">
            <p>The direction-specific pan values are useful for customizing some overscroll behaviors.
               For example, to implement a simple pull-to-refresh effect the document's <code>touch-action</code> can be set to <code>pan-x pan-down</code> whenever the scroll position is 0 and <code>pan-x pan-y</code> otherwise.
               This allows pointer event handlers to define the behavior for upward panning/scrolling that start from the top of the document.</p>
            <p>The direction-specific pan values can also be used for composing a component that implements custom panning with pointer event handling within an element that scrolls natively (or vice-versa).
               For example, an image carousel may use <code>pan-y</code> to ensure it receives pointer events for any horizontal pan operations without interfering with vertical panning of the document.
               When the carousel reaches its right-most extent, it may change its <code>touch-action</code> to <code>pan-y pan-right</code> so that a subsequent scroll operation beyond its extent can scroll the document within the viewport if possible.
               It's not possible to change the behavior of a panning/scrolling operation while it is taking place.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="note">Disabling some default direct manipulation behaviors for panning and zooming may allow user agents to respond to other behaviors more quickly. For example, with <code>auto</code> user agents typically add 300ms of delay before <code>click</code> to allow for double-tap gestures to be handled. In these cases, explicitly setting <code>touch-action: none</code> or <code>touch-action: manipulation</code> will remove this delay. Note that the methods for determining a tap or double-tap gesture are out of scope for this specification.</div>

        <section class='informative'>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Pointer capture allows the events for a particular pointer (including any <a>compatibility mouse events</a>) to be retargeted to a particular element other than the normal hit test result of the pointer's location. This is useful in scenarios like a custom slider control (e.g. similar to the [[HTML]] <code>&lt;input type="range"&gt;</code> control). Pointer capture can be set on the slider thumb element, allowing the user to slide the control back and forth even if the pointer slides off of the thumb.</p>

If <a data-lt="Element.releasePointerCapture">releasePointerCapture()</a> is not called for the pointer before the next pointer event is fired, then a <a>gotpointercapture event</a> will be dispatched to the target (as normal) indicating that capture is active.</p>
            <div class="note">This is a breaking change from [[PointerEvents]], but does not impact the vast majority of existing content. In addition to matching typical platform UX conventions, this design for implicit capture enables user agents to make a performance optimization which prevents the need to invoke hit-testing on touch movement events without explicit developer opt-in (consistent with the performance properties of existing dominant native and web APIs for touch input).</div>
            <div class="note">In addition, user agents may implement implicit pointer capture behavior for all input devices on specific UI widgets such as input range controls (allowing some finger movement to stray outside of the form control itself during the interaction).</div>

               the user agent MUST clear the <a>pending pointer capture target override</a>
               for the <code>pointerId</code> of the <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code> event that was just dispatched,
               and then run <a href="#process-pending-pointer-capture">Process Pending Pointer Capture</a> steps to fire <code>lostpointercapture</code> if necessary.
               After running <a href="#process-pending-pointer-capture">Process Pending Pointer Capture</a> steps,
               if the pointer supports hover, user agent MUST also send corresponding boundary events necessary
               to reflect the current position of the pointer with no capture.</p>
            <p>If the user agent supports firing the <code>click</code> event
               (see <a title="compatibility mouse events" href="#dfn-compatibility-mouse-events">compatibility mouse events</a>),
               and if in an implicit release scenario both <code>click</code> and <code>lostpointercapture</code> events are fired,
               <code>click</code> SHOULD be fired before <code>lostpointercapture</code>.</p>

            <p>When a pointer lock [[PointerLock]] is successfully applied on an element, the user agent MUST run the steps as if the <a data-lt='Element.releasePointerCapture'>releasePointerCapture()</a> method has been called if any element is set to be captured or pending to be captured.

        <h1><dfn>Coalesced and predicted events</dfn></h1>

        <div class="note">This specification does not define how user agents should coalesce or
        predict pointer movement data. It only specifies the API for accessing this information.</div>

        <section>
            <h2><dfn>Coalesced events</dfn></h2>

            <p>For performance reasons, user agents may choose not to send a <code>pointermove</code>
            event every time a <a data-lt="measurable properties">measurable property</a>
            (such as coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or contact geometry)
            of a pointer is updated. Instead, they may coalesce (combine/merge) multiple changes into
            a single <code>pointermove</code> or <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event. While
            this approach helps in reducing the amount of event handling the user agent must perform,
            it will naturally reduce the granularity and fidelity when tracking a pointer position,
            particularly for fast and large movements. Using the
            <code><a data-lt="PointerEvent.getCoalescedEvents">getCoalescedEvents()</a></code> method
            it is possible for applications to access the raw, un-coalesced position changes. These
            allow for a more precise handling of pointer movement data. In the case of drawing
            applications, for instance, the un-coalesced events can be used to draw smoother curves that
            more closely match the actual movement of a pointer.</p>

                angular and jagged; the same line drawn using the more granular points provided by
                <code>getCoalescedEvents()</code> (the red circles) results in a smoother approximation
                of the pointer movement.</figcaption>

            <p>Some user agents have built-in algorithms which, after a series of confirmed pointer movements,
            can make a prediction (based on past points, and the speed/trajectory of the movement) what
            the position of future pointer movements may be. Applications can use this information with
            the <code><a data-lt="PointerEvent.getPredictedEvents">getPredictedEvents()</a></code> method to speculatively "draw ahead" to a predicted position
            to reduce perceived latency, and then discarding these predicted points once the actual points
            are received.</p>

        <h1><dfn data-lt="compatibility mouse events">Compatibility mapping with mouse events</dfn></h1>
        <p>The vast majority of web content existing today codes only to Mouse Events. The following describes an algorithm for how the user agent MAY map generic pointer input to mouse events for compatibility with this content.</p>
        <p>The compatibility mapping with mouse events are an OPTIONAL feature of this specification. User agents are encouraged to support the feature for best compatibility with existing legacy content. User agents that do not support compatibility mouse events are still encouraged to support the <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> events (see the note below).</p>
        <p>The <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> events, defined in [[UIEVENTS]], are not considered <a>compatibility mouse events</a> as they are typically tied to user interface activation, and are fired from other (non-pointer) input devices, such as keyboards.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>In user agents that support firing <code>click</code> and/or <code>contextmenu</code>, calling <code>preventDefault</code> during a pointer event typically does not have an effect on whether <code>click</code> and/or <code>contextmenu</code> are fired or not. Because they are not compatibility mouse events, user agents typically fire <code>click</code> and <code>contextmenu</code> for all pointing devices, including pointers that are not primary pointers.</p>
            <p>The relative ordering of these high-level events (<code>click</code>, <code>contextmenu</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>blur</code>, etc.) with pointer events is undefined and varies between user agents. For example, in some user agents <code>contextmenu</code> will often follow a <code>pointerup</code>, in others it'll often precede a <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointercancel</code>, and in some situations it may be fired without any corresponding pointer event (such as a keyboard shortcut).</p>
            <p>In addition, user agents may apply their own heuristics to determine whether or not a <code>click</code> or <code>contextmenu</code> event should be fired. Some user agents may only fire these events for a primary pointer, and even then they may choose not to fire these events if there are other (non-primary) pointers of the same type, or other primary pointers of a different type. User agents may determine that a particular action was not a "clean" tap, click or long-press — for instance, if an interaction with a finger on a touch screen includes too much movement while the finger is in contact with the screen — and decide not to fire a <code>click</code> or <code>contextmenu</code> event. These aspects of user agent behavior are not defined in this specification, and they may differ between implementations.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Unless otherwise noted, the target of any mapped mouse event SHOULD be the same target as the respective pointer event unless the target is no longer participating in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree. In this case, the mouse event should be fired at the original target's nearest ancestor node (at the time it was removed from the tree) that still participates in its <code>ownerDocument</code>'s tree, meaning that a new event path (based on the new target node) is built for the mouse event.</p>
        <p>Authors can prevent the production of certain compatibility mouse events by canceling the <code>pointerdown</code> event.</p>
        <p>Mouse events can only be prevented when the pointer is down. Hovering pointers (e.g. a mouse with no buttons pressed) cannot have their mouse events prevented.</p>
        <p>The <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code>, and <code>mouseleave</code> events are never prevented (even if the pointer is down).</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p>Compatibility mouse events can't be prevented when a pointer event {{EventListener}} is set to be {{AddEventListenerOptions/passive}} [[DOM]].</p>

        <section>
            <h2><dfn>Tracking the effective position of the legacy mouse pointer</dfn></h2>

Since all these compatibility events would appear to MouseEvent code to be coming from a single mouse device, user agents are encouraged to guarantee that the compatibility mouse events are consistent from a single device perspective. For mouse transition events (i.e., <code>mouseover</code>, <code>mouseout</code>, <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>), this means the entry/exit state for every event target is valid as implied by [[UIEVENTS]].

                <li>Let |T| be the target of the <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointerup</code> or <code>pointermove</code> event being dispatched. For the <code>pointerleave</code> event, unset |T|.</li>

            <p>Some devices, such as most touchscreens, do not support hovering a coordinate (or set of coordinates) while not in the active state. Much existing content coded to mouse events assumes that a mouse is producing the events and thus certain qualities are generally true:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The input can hover independently of activation (e.g. moving a mouse cursor without any buttons pressed).</li>
                <li>The input will likely produce the <code>mousemove</code> event on an element before clicking it.</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Converting between <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> and <code>altitudeAngle</code> / <code>azimuthAngle</code></h2>
        <p>Pointer Events include two complementary sets of attributes to express the orientation of a transducer relative to the X-Y plane:
            <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> (introduced in the original Pointer Events specification), and
            <code>azimuthAngle</code> / <code>altitudeAngle</code>
            (adopted from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/">Touch Events - Level 2</a> specification).</p>
        <p>Depending on the specific hardware and platform, user agents will likely only receive one set of values for the transducer orientation relative to the screen plane — either <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> or <code>altitudeAngle</code> / <code>azimuthAngle</code>. User agents MUST use the following algorithm for converting these values.</p>
        <p>When the user agent calculates <code>tiltX</code> / <code>tiltY</code> from <code>azimuthAngle</code> / <code>altitudeAngle</code> it SHOULD
            round the final integer values using <a data-cite="ECMASCRIPT#sec-math.round">Math.round</a> [[ECMASCRIPT]] rules.</p>

        <h2>Security and privacy considerations</h2>
        <p>This appendix discusses security and privacy considerations for Pointer Events implementations. The discussion is limited to security and privacy issues that arise directly from implementation of the event model, APIs and events defined in this specification.</p>
        <p>Many of the event types defined in this specification are dispatched in response to user actions. This allows malicious event listeners to gain access to information users would typically consider confidential, e.g., the exact path/movement of a user's mouse/stylus/finger while interacting with a page.</p>
        <p>Pointer events contain additional information (where supported by the user's device), such as the angle or tilt at which a pen input is held, the geometry of the contact surface, and the pressure exerted on the stylus or touch screen. Information about angle, tilt, geometry and pressure are directly related to sensors on the user's device, meaning that this specification allows an origin access to these sensors.</p>
        <p>This sensor data, as well as the ability to determine the type of input mechanism (mouse, touch, pen) used, may be used to infer characteristics of a user, or of the user's device and environment. These inferred characteristics and any device/environment information may themselves be sensitive — for instance, they may allow a malicious site to further infer if a user is using assistive technologies. This information can also be potentially used for the purposes of building a user profile and/or attempting to "fingerprint" and track a particular user.</p>
        <p>As mitigation, user agents may consider including the ability for users to disable access to particular sensor data (such as angle, tilt, pressure), and/or to make it available only after an explicit opt-in from the user.</p>
        <p>Beyond these considerations, the working group believes that this specification:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Does not expose personally-identifiable information.</li>
            <li>Does not deal with high-value data.</li>
            <li>Does not introduce new state for an origin that persists across browsing sessions.</li>
            <li>Does not expose persistent, cross-origin state to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not expose any other data to an origin that it doesn’t currently have access to.</li>
            <li>Does not enable new script execution/loading mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to a user’s location.</li>
            <li>Does not require any special handling when the user agent is in "incognito" mode.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin access to other devices.</li>
            <li>Does not allow an origin control over a user agent’s native UI.</li>
            <li>Does not expose temporary identifiers to the web.</li>
            <li>Does not distinguish between behavior in first-party and third-party contexts.</li>
            <li>Does not persist data to a user’s local device.</li>
            <li>Does not allow downgrading default security characteristics.</li>
        </ul>

                    </ul>
                    <div class="note">On some platforms, the set of active pointers includes all pointer input to the device, including any that are not targeted at the user agent (e.g. those targeted at other applications).</div>

                <dd>A type of input sensing device in which a surface can detect input which is in contact and/or in close proximity. Most commonly, this is the surface that senses input from the touch contact or a pen/stylus.</dd>
            <dt><dfn>direct manipulation</dfn></dt>
                <dd>Certain user agents (such as browsers on a touchscreen device) implement a "direct manipulation" metaphor where a pointer not only interacts with controls, but
                is also used to directly pan or zoom the current page, providing the illusion of direct physical contact. As an example, users on a touchscreen device are generally
                able to use a finger or a stylus to "grab" a page and pan it by moving the pointer, directly manipulating the page. Contrast this with a mouse pointer on a regular
                desktop/laptop, where panning is done by using a scrollbar, rather than by "dragging" the page.
                <div class="note">In some cases, touchpads (like those found on a laptop) will allow the user to scroll by "dragging" on the touchpad. However, this is generally achieved
                by the touchpad generating "fake" mouse wheel events, so this wouldn't count as a direct manipulation.</div>
