      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document reflects incubation for APIs which are intended to be part of a future version of the Pointer Events specification. They are not yet broadly supported by implementations.
      </p>
      <p>
	The <code>getCoalescedEvents</code> API (similar to Android <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent.html#getHistoricalX(int, int)">getHistorical</a> APIs
        and iOS <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/api/member/MonoTouch.UIKit.UIEvent.GetCoalescedTouches/p/MonoTouch.UIKit.UITouch/">GetCoalescedTouches</a> API) exposes all the events
        that were coalesced into a single event.
        User agents may coalesce a stream of events into a single event sent to javascript.
        This situation can occur when many events are generated by the hardware in between the requestAnimationFrame boundaries or for long running javascript code that misses the frame boundary.
        Basically, if the javascript handlers process the events and update the screen contents faster than the screen refresh rate only the last update will render and show in the next frame.
        So for example, if there were multiple <code>pointermove</code> events happened from the last requestAnimationFrame callback, UA can coalesce all of them into one event and send only
        that event before the next requestAnimationFrame representing the last state of the pointer.
        Most applications care only about the last coordinates and not the intermediate coordinates that occurred.
        However, a class of applications such as drawing applications may wish precise (subframe timing) coordinates in order to draw better detailed lines.
        The <code>getCoalescedEvents</code> API can be used in those scenarios to get all the coalesced events from the event that was dispatched to the javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
       The <code>getPredictedEvents</code> API tries to achieve the minimal latency for drawing app similar to other platforms such as
       iOS <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/touches_presses_and_gestures/handling_touches_in_your_view/minimizing_latency_with_predicted_touches">prediction APIs</a>.
       The drawing latency on the web comes from a wide variety of factors such as UA input pipeline latency and multi level bufferings of the output buffer.
       This API exposes what UA thinks the near future state of  pointer will be and the web app can choose to use that state for example to draw those points temporarily for the current frame.
       That would help to reduce the perception of overall latency when user interacts with the page.
      </p>
      <p>
       While for most apps getting all the events and their history before rAF and drawing the result on the page is enough, more time sensitive apps care to get the event as soon as they arrive.
       They might be sending input events over the network or play a musical note that aren't necessarily tied to the frame time and the screen refresh rate. Coalescing events or rAF-aligning them would hurt those apps.
       The new pointerevent type <code>pointerrawupdate</code> that fires immedinatedly as they arrive introduced in this spec would help those usecases. Note that there are some considerations around this that will be discussed later in this spec.

      <h2>Extensions to the Pointer Event types</h2>
      <p>Below is a new <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event type as well as a modification to the <code>pointermove</code> event in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/index.html#pointer-event-types">existing pointer event types</a>.</p>
      <section>
        <h3>The <dfn><code>pointermove</code> event</dfn></h3>
        <p>A user agent MUST <a href="#firing-events-using-the-pointerevent-interface">fire a pointer event</a> named <code>pointermove</code> when a pointer changes button state.
        Additionally one <code>pointermove</code> MUST be fired when pointer changes coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or
        contact geometry (e.g. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>) and the circumstances produce no other pointer events defined in this specification.
        These events may be coalesced or aligned to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#event-loop-processing-model">animation frame callbacks</a> based on UA decision.
        The coalesced events information will be exposed via <code><a data-lt="getCoalescedEvents">getCoalescedEvents</a></code> API for the single dispatched <code>pointermove</code> event.
        The final coordinates of such events should be used for finding the target of the event.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The <dfn><code>pointerrawupdate</code> event</dfn></h3>
        <p>A user agent MUST <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/index.html#firing-events-using-the-pointerevent-interface">fire a pointer event</a>
           named <code>pointerrawupdate</code> when a pointing device attribute
           (i.e. button state, coordinates, pressure, tangential pressure, tilt, twist, or contact geometry) is changed.
           As oppose to <code>pointermove</code> which might be aligned to animation callbacks,
           user agents SHOULD dispatch <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events as soon as possible
           and as frequent as the javascript can handle the events.
           The <code>target</code> of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events might be different from the <code>pointermove</code> events
           due to the fact that <code>pointermove</code> events might get aligned with animation frame callbacks and get coalesced and the final position of the event
           which is used for finding the <code>target</code> could be different from its coalesced events.
           Note that if there is already another <code>pointerrawupdate</code> with the same <code>pointerId</code> that hasn't been dispatched
           in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#task-queue">task queue</a>
           user agent MAY coalesce the new <code>pointerrawupdate</code> with that event instead of creating a new <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-task">task</a>.
           So this may cause <code>pointerrawupdate</code> to have coalesced events and
           they will all be delivered as coalesced events of one <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event as soon as
           the event's turn to get processed reaches in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#task-queue">task queue</a>.
           See <a href="#getCoalescedEvents">getCoalescedEvents</a> for more information.
           In terms of ordering of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> and <code>pointermove</code>,
           if the UA received an update from the platform that causes both <code>pointerrawupdate</code> and <code>pointermove</code> events
           then the user agent MUST dispatch <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event before the correponding <code>pointermove</code> for it.
           Other than the <code>target</code>, the concatenation of coalesced events of all dispatched <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events
           since the last <code>pointermove</code> event is the same as coalesced events of the next <code>pointermove</code> event in terms of the other attributes.
           The attributes of <code>pointerrawupdate</code> are mostly the same as <code>pointermove</code> with the exception of
           <code>cancelable</code> which MUST be false for <code>pointerrawupdate</code>.
           User agent SHOULD not fire <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/index.html#dfn-compatibility-mouse-events">compatibility mouse events</a> for <code>pointerrawupdate</code>.</p>
           <div class="note">Adding listener for this type of the event might impact the performance of the web page negatively depending on the implementation of user agent.
           For most of the use cases the other pointerevent types should suffice.
           A <code>pointerrawupdate</code> listener should only be added if javascript needs high frequency events and can handle them just as fast.
           In that case there is probably no need to listen to other types of pointer events for most of the use cases.</div>

      <h2>Extensions to the <code>PointerEvent</code> interface</h2>
      <p>

            <p>A <a>PointerEvent</a> has an associated <dfn>coalesced event list</dfn> (a list of

            or <code>pointerrawupdate</code> event, it is a sequence of all <code> PointerEvent

            <p>A <a>PointerEvent</a> has an associated <dfn>predicted event list</dfn> (a list of

            empty list.
            The number of events in the list and how far they are from the current timestamp are

      <h2>Timing of coalesced event firing</h2>
      <p>Coalescing only happens for <code>pointermove</code>  and <code>pointerrawupdate</code> events.
         Note that user agents don't need to hit-test all the coalesced events as all of them will have the same target as the dispatched event.</p>
      <p>When the user agent dispatches any <code>PointerEvent</code> it MUST dispatch all the events held back so far for coalescing, regardless of their <code>pointerIds</code>. The ordering of all these dispatched events should be in a way that resemebles the most with the actual events' ordering. For example if a <code>pointerdown</code> event causes the dispatch for the coalesced <code>pointermove</code> events the user agent SHOULD first dispatch one <code>pointermove</code> event with all those coalesced events of a <code>pointerId</code> followed by the <code>pointerdown</code> event.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of the actual events happening in one frame with increasing <code>timestamps</code> and the events dispatched by the user agent:
        <table class="parameters">
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Actual events</th><th>Dispatched events</th> </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><code>pointermove</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=2</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td><code>pointermove</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=1</td><td></td></tr>

            <tr><td><code>pointermove</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=1</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td><code>pointermove</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=2</td><td></td></tr>
            <tr><td><code>pointerdown</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=1</td><td>
                <code>pointermove</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=1 and two coalesced events<br>

                <code>pointerdown</code> with <code>pointerId</code>=1 and zero coalesced events<br>

         from [[!pointerevents2]] to add the <code>pan-left</code>, <code>pan-left</code>, <code>pan-up</code>, <code>pan-down</code> values.

      <p>The user agent MAY consider touches that begin on the element only for the purposes of scrolling that
         starts in any of the directions specified by all of the listed values.
         Once scrolling is started, the direction may be reversed by the user even if scrolls that start in the reversed direction are disallowed.
         In contrast, when scrolling is restricted to starting along a single axis (eg. <code>pan-y</code>), the axis cannot be changed during the scroll.
         In the case of <code>pan-left</code>, <code>pan-right</code>, <code>pan-up</code> and <code>pan-down</code>,
         the direction is interpreted as the opposite of the physical movement in the local coordinate space.
         For example, <code>pan-up</code> corresponds to input event sequences where typically <code>screenY</code>
         is increasing (i.e. an interaction where the user moves a touch point down the screen)
         when the element has no effective CSS transforms.
         If the element is effectively rotated by 90 degrees counter-clockwise,
         <code>pan-up</code> would then correspond to input event sequences where <code>screenX</code> is increasing.
     </p>
     <div class="note">The direction-specific pan values are useful for customizing overscroll behavior.
       For example, to implement a simple pull-to-refresh effect the document's touch-action can be set to <code>pan-x pan-down</code>
       whenever the scroll position is 0 and <code>pan-x pan-y</code> otherwise.
       This allows pointer event handlers to define the behavior for upward scrolls that start from the top of the document.
       <p>The direction-specific pan values can also be used for composing a component that implements custom panning with
          pointer event handling within an element that scrolls natively (or vice-versa).
          For example, an image carousel may use <code>pan-y</code> to ensure it receives pointer events for any horizontal pan operations
          without interfering with vertical scrolling of the document.
          When the carousel reaches its right-most extent, it may change its touch-action to <code>pan-y pan-right</code> so that
          a subsequent pan operation beyond it's extent can scroll the document within the viewport if possible.
          It's not possible to change the behavior of a pan in the middle of an operation.
