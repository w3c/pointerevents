        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Web browsers can receive input in a variety of ways including mouse, touch, and pen input. A “pointer” is an abstract form of input that can be any point of contact on a input surface made by a mouse cursor, pen, finger, or multiple fingers.</p>

        <p>Pointer Events provide support for handling mouse, touch, and pen input for web sites and web applications through DOM Events. For example, a content creator using Pointer Events would only have use a single model, rather than separate code paths for mouse events, touch events, and pen-tablet events, making authoring content much more efficient and inclusive.</p>

        <p>This Working Group seeks to enhance the features delivered in the Pointer Events Level 2 Recommendation by exploring changes, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Addition of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/extension.html#additional-touch-action-values">direction-specific values for <code>touch-action</code></a>, giving finer-grained control of panning touch behaviors</li>
            <li>Support for querying <a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/extension.html#extensions-to-the-pointerevent-interface">coalesced and predicted pointer events</a></li>
            <li>Clarifying relationship between pointer events and other behaviors/event models, such as drag and drop</li>
            <li>Additional clarifications of API behavior and performance optimizations (see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Afuture-v3">issues marked for future consideration in GitHub</a>)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>Gestures. Examples of out-of-scope gesture functionality and APIs include, but are not limited to, the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Comparisons between pointers to determine an action (e.g., panning for scrollable regions, pinch for zooming, press-and-hold for a mouse right-click).</li>
                  <li>Comparisons between time stamps of pointers to determine an action.</li>
                  <li>Comparisons between combinations of pointers and/or their time stamps to determine an action.</li>
                  <li>Determining an action based on comparison to a threshold (e.g., scroll speed based on a pressure threshold, panning based on distance threshold, press-and-hold based on a timing threshold).</li>
                  <li>APIs or functionality processing data that is indicative of a confidence level that a pointer is associated with a gesture.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Higher level APIs used to convey user intent.
                <ul>
                  <li>High-level representational events, which are in the scope of the Web Events and IndieUI working groups.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Input targeting methods and disambiguation.
                <ul>
                  <li>The algorithms and underlying systems used to determine target elements and pointer location.</li>
                  <li>Algorithms to determine unintended input (e.g. palm rejection). </li>
                </ul>
              </li>

              <li>Equipment used to detect input events.
                <ul>
                  <li>Sensors, algorithms, and systems used to detect physical interactions and convert them into input events.</li>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The working group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="pointerevents-v2" class="spec new"><a href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Level 3</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification builds upon the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/">Pointer Events Level 2 specification</a>. This specification defines a unified interface for web applications to access event information related to pointing devices. This includes mouse, pen, multi-touch screen, and related input mechanisms. While device-specific information such as pressure or contact geometry might be included in the events, web developers can program against the events without needing to know what type of device created them.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration, with the agreement from each participant to Royalty-Free licensing of those submissions under the W3C Patent Policy.

          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>. Meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="">Pointer Events Working Group home page.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Pointer Events Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its technical work on the public mailing list <a id="public-name" href="mailto:public-pointer-events@w3.org">public-pointer-events@w3.org</a> (<a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-pointer-events/">archive</a>). The public is invited to post messages to this list. Additional discussion is conducted on <a href="https://github.com/w3c/pointerevents/">Github</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/policies#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
